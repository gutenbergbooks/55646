<h2><i>Preface</i></h2>
</div>

<p>To the Honorable Samuel Coffin Eastman, of Concord,
New Hampshire, belongs the credit of having
given American readers an English version of <i>The
Family at Gilje</i> while the author was still at the
height of his creative activity. Mr. Eastman, who
was a lawyer by profession, was a man of varied
interests, the author of a White Mountain Guide
which has gone through numerous editions, and
the translator of Brandes's <i>Impressions of Russia</i> and
<i>Poland</i>. He was familiar with the translations by
Mrs. Ole Bull of Jonas Lie's <i>The Pilot and His
Wife</i> and <i>The Good Ship Future</i>. <i>The Family at Gilje</i>
was called to his attention by Miss Amalia Krohg,
of Christiania, and it charmed him so much that
he rendered it into English. The translation appeared
serially in the Concord magazine, <i>The Granite
Monthly</i>, in 1894, and was illustrated with views
from Valders, the mountain district where the scene
of the story is laid.</p>

<p>When the Committee on Publications decided
to include <i>The Family at Gilje</i> in the <span class="smcap">Scandinavian
Classics</span>, their attention was called to Mr. Eastman's
excellent version, and permission was secured
to reprint it. The translator consented to a revision
of his text so as to make it conform to the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
style of the <span class="smcap">Classics</span> and to interpret more accurately
some of the Norwegian idioms. His death,
in 1917, prevented his co&#246;peration in the work of
revision, to which, nevertheless, he had given his
cordial assent.</p>

<h2><i>Introduction</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> story of Jonas Lie's life, even though
told in brief, will readily yield the key to the
various phases of his strange authorship. No one
of his long list of books is an adequate index of his
powers. The special character of each is the outgrowth
of peculiar traits of natural endowment in
conjunction with definite facts and experiences of
his life. Some of the features of his genius seem
strangely incongruous&mdash;as different as day and
night. These features are clearly reflected in his writings.
By critics he has been variously proclaimed
"the poet of Nordland," "the novelist of the sea,"
or "the novelist of Norwegian homes," and is commonly
classed as a realist. His reputation and great
popularity rest mainly upon his realistic novels. In
this field he ranks as one of the leading portrayers
of character and social conditions in modern Norse
literature; and of his realism <i>The Family at Gilje</i> is
possibly the best illustration.</p>

<p>Yet there was much more than an ingenuous
realist in Lie.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> He was also a fascinating mystic; a
teller of fantastic stories, profoundly symbolic in
character; a great myth-making <i>raconteur</i> of grotesque
tales that have a distinct folkloristic flavor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
particularly as found in his two volumes entitled
<i>Trold</i>. This part of his authorship, though it does
not bulk large, and, naturally enough, has not been
fathomed by the general reader, is nevertheless a
very important part, and is surely the most original
and poetic. It appears in a definite though restrained
form as mystic romanticism in his first prose work,
<i>Second Sight</i>, and then scarcely a trace of it is seen
until it bursts forth, twenty years later, with the
vigor of long-repressed passion.</p>

<p>It would therefore be unfair to judge Jonas Lie
by the single novel in hand&mdash;as unfair as it would
be to judge Ibsen by a single one of his social dramas&mdash;<i>The
Pillars of Society</i>, for instance. In Ibsen
the imaginative power displayed in <i>Brand</i> and <i>Peer
Gynt</i> did not in the social dramas reassert itself in
anything but an adumbration of the abandon and
exuberance of the dramatic poems. In Lie, however,
the mystic and myth-maker reappeared with
strength redoubled. Erik Lie, in a book on his
father's life (<i>Oplevelser</i>), says with reference to this:
"If it had been given to Jonas Lie to continue his
authorship in his last years, his Nordland nature
would surely&mdash;such is my belief&mdash;more and more
have asserted itself, and he would have dived down
into the misty world of the subconscious, where his
near-sighted eyes saw so clearly, and whence his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
first works sprang up like fantastic plants on the
bottom of the sea." There is not a trace or an inkling
of this clairvoyant power in <i>The Family at Gilje</i>.
Its excellences are of a distinctly different nature.</p>

<p>This much, then, must be said to warn the reader
against a too hasty appraisement of Lie's genius&mdash;his
power, range, and vision&mdash;on the basis of a single
novel. Let him be assured that Jonas Lie stands
worthily by the side of Ibsen and Bj&#246;rnson both as
a creative author and as a personality. He was of
their generation, knew them both well as young
men and old, and was a loyal friend to both, as they
were to him. He even knew Bj&#246;rnson well enough
in the early sixties to give him pointed advice on
his authorship. Though he seems never to have
taken such liberties with Ibsen,&mdash;as Bj&#246;rnson so
categorically did during the same decade,&mdash;he did
lend him a helping hand by paying him in advance
for the dramatic poem, <i>Love's Comedy</i>, published in
a periodical owned by Lie. It is interesting to note
that Ibsen, so punctilious in later years, was aggravatingly
slow in forwarding the final batch of manuscript.
As a last resource, Lie threatened to complete
the drama himself. Later in life, during summer
sojourns in the Bavarian Alps, they saw much
of each other. In one of his social dramas, <i>An Enemy
of the People</i>, Ibsen used Lie, together with traits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
Bj&#246;rnson and Apothecary Thaulow (father of the
painter) as a model for the genial hero, Dr. Stockmann.
Both Ibsen and Bj&#246;rnson were generous in
their praise of Lie's many fine qualities. In the sixties,
before Lie had written a single novel, Bj&#246;rnson,
in an address at Troms&#246;, in Arctic Norway, where
Lie had spent several years of his boyhood, said
some striking things about Lie's creative powers.
On a later occasion he referred to him as "the great
vague possibility," and after Lie's death, in a letter
to the family, he said: "I have so much to thank
him for. In the luxuriant wealth of my youth he was
the purest in heart, the richest in fancy." Bj&#246;rnson
understood from the first the clairvoyant mysticism
in Lie, and profited by it. In other words, a man
who could interest men like Ibsen and Bj&#246;rnson
and maintain their admiration and respect for half
a century could do so only by dint of rare personal
powers.</p>

<p>Although he did not begin his literary career
until he was getting on toward forty, at which age
both Ibsen and Bj&#246;rnson had won fame, Lie, it may
fairly be said, eventually overtook them in the favor
of the Scandinavian reading public, and it is not
unlikely that with this public he will hold his own
in comparison with them. This is surely due to the
realism of his social novels. Though he at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
roamed far afield from the standards of realism, as
has been indicated, he never was identified with extremists
in any literary school, despite the sweeping
force of popular currents. As a realist he was
a patient plodder, following his own instincts, and
in the course of long years he hammered out a literary
vehicle distinctly his own, so surcharged, in
fact, with the idiosyncrasies of his individuality as to
make it most difficult to recast in a foreign idiom.</p>

<p>From the above it will appear that Lie was an interesting
dual personality. Further consideration of
his life will show that he was both romanticist, or
mystic, and realist by right of blood, as well as
through environment and personal experience.</p>

<p>Scandinavian romanticism began in Denmark
with the opening of the nineteenth century, as a revival
of the past, the exploitation of Northern antiquities
for modern literary material. In Norway,
a generation or so later, romanticism grew out of an
enthusiastic study of popular ballads and folk-lore
stories still found on the lips of the peasantry. In
connection with this there developed an intense interest
in rural scenery and life on the part of both
artists and poets. The movement continued for a
generation, until the early seventies, and found its
best conscious literary expression in Bj&#246;rnson's
peasant idyls. When Jonas Lie had resolved to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
an author (1870), there was one region of romantic
inspiration that had not been utilized. This
was Nordland, one of the northerly provinces of
Norway, beyond the Arctic Circle, under the glory
of the midnight sun, where, however, a long and
sunless winter fostered in the minds of the inhabitants
a brooding melancholy which peopled mountain
and sea, nature's every nook and cranny, with
strange and awe-inspiring creatures. In this nature
of colossal contrasts Jonas Lie spent several years
of his boyhood, and the tremendous impression left
on his sensitive and poetic mind are very evident
in his first novel, <i>Second Sight</i> (<i>Den Fremsynte</i>), also
known in English as <i>The Visionary</i> and <i>The Seer</i>.
This, together with some lesser stories that followed,
gave the Nordland stamp to Lie's earliest
fiction&mdash;the stamp of romanticism, mysticism, and
clairvoyance. The effect of this environment was
accentuated by powerful innate impulses, for his
ancestral heritage reveals a double strain, to which
allusion has already been made. On his father's side
there were, for several generations, brains, energy,
and good sense, with a predilection for law and administration.
The father himself was a country magistrate
of sterling uprightness. Here, then, plainly
enough, is the source of the novelist's realism, as
found, for example, in <i>The Family at Gilje</i>, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
nothing whatever to indicate the poet and romancer.
These surely can be traced to the mother, who was
a most remarkable woman, born in one of the
northern provinces, and, as Lie himself believed,
with either Finnish (<i>i.e.</i>, Lappic) or Gypsy blood
in her veins, and possibly both. Professor Boyesen,
in <i>Essays on Scandinavian Literature</i>, says of
Lie's mother: "I remember well this black-eyed,
eccentric little lady, with her queer ways and still
more extraordinary conversation. It is from her that
Jonas Lie has inherited the fantastic strain in his
blood, the strange superstitious terrors, and the
luxuriant wealth of color which he lavished upon
his first novel, <i>The Man of Second Sight</i>. She was
unusually gifted intellectually, had pronounced literary
interests, and revealed some decided clairvoyant
qualities." Lie himself said of her: "There was
something of a seer in her&mdash;something that reminded
one of spae-women and the like." "Imagine,"
says Arne Garborg,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> in his book on Lie,
"this restless blood infused into the strong, sober,
practical nature of the Lies: what should come of
such a mixture but that peculiar combination of
reality and romanticism that we know by the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
of Jonas Lie, the poet of Finnish magic and sorcery&mdash;and
of plain reality." In Nordland, where
his maternal inheritance had its source, Lie as a boy
found things fit to satisfy the cravings of such an
imagination as the Finn in him possessed. In this
Brobdingnagian realm he heard tales and legends
of Finnish sorcery, of shipwrecks caused by fierce
water-bogies (<i>draugs</i>), of giant trolls, and a thousand
other demoniacal creatures of morbid popular
fancy, until he was chilled with terror, the effects
of which clung to him for life, made him as a mature
man afraid of the dark, and finally cropped out in
tales of weird and grotesque imagery.</p>

<p>These, then, are the fundamental facts that are
necessary for comprehension of the duality in Lie's
nature and authorship.</p>

<p class="p3t">Jonas Lie was born in southern Norway, in 1833,
and at the age of five removed with the family to
Nordland. His life as an author began in 1870; but
between these dates there was a period of very unusual
experiences. His vivid imagination, stirred by
the witchery of life in Nordland, made the prosy
tasks of school seem direst punishment. He was
counted a dullard and an incorrigible mischief-maker.
At the age of thirteen it was his passion to
become a sailor. The father, at his wits' end, compromised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
by sending him to a naval academy. Here he
was at times thought mad by his instructors, who
saw something of his semi-somnambulistic antics.
Near-sightedness, however, proved an obstacle to
his continuance in <i>this</i> path to maritime glory,
which he was destined to win by a different route.
After an awakening experience in a Bergen school,
where an eccentric poet-pedagogue thought him a
"lad of pairts," and his classmates voted him a prize
liar on account of his Nordland stories, he took a
short cut to the university at Heltberg's so-called
Student Factory in Christiania, the head-master of
which&mdash;a prodigy who has been immortalized in
literature by both Bj&#246;rnson and Garborg&mdash;proved
an inspiring and fructifying force to his groping
genius. At this institution, among a motley horde
of country bumpkins, shipwrecked city talent, and
budding genius, he found Bj&#246;rnson, also preparing
for the university. Both were profoundly impressed
by the genius of the asthmatic head-master in his
dogskin jacket, who led his young barbarians by
forced marches through the Alpine passes of Latin
syntax into the classic domain of Livy and Horace.
We shall see that he came to Lie's rescue at a later
period.</p>

<p>Lie entered the university in 1851, and took a
degree in law in 1858. It had been a difficult task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
for him to decide what professional study to pursue.
He thought at first that he had leanings toward
theology, bought the necessary books, kept them
a day, then exchanged them for law books, after
having paid a brief but adequate visit to the clinical
laboratory. These years at the university, when a
romantic interest in everything Norwegian filled
the air with mystic expectancy of great things to
come in the way of a regenerated Norway, aroused
Lie. Association with Bj&#246;rnson, Ibsen, Vinje,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Nordraak,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
and a score of other gifted young men was
stimulating, yet he did not become a disciple or
slavish follower of any of these more vehement natures.
He had his own ideas, and was boldly independent
when occasion demanded it, as both King
Oscar and Bj&#246;rnson later in life ascertained to their
discomfort, each of them having tried in vain to
make the "amiable" author conform to their plans
and ideas. Among the many friends that Lie made
in the capital city during his university days, Bj&#246;rnson
became the most intimate. He seems from the
very first to have espied the artist in Lie, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
much to help him in understanding his own strange
self. It had begun to worry Lie that his friends
thought him eccentric. And not only this: the mystic,
superstitious, magic-loving Finn in his nature
often frightened him. Hence he made great efforts
to counteract his tendency to fantastic musing and
to develop his paternal heritage: the rationalist and
realist in himself. For this purpose the determination
to study law was doubtless a wise step. But his
legal studies did not suppress his literary yearnings,
which found expression in verse that did not
at first go beyond a circle of intimate friends. He
saw no prospect of making a living with his pen, and
so entered a government office&mdash;a decision hastily
made under pressure of respect for his stern and
practical father, who had announced a visit to the
capital city. Nevertheless, he dreamed of becoming
an author, and began contributing poems to the
daily press. They seemed labored and heavy, and
attracted no particular attention. On the other
hand, he prepared some well-written articles on
European politics, which indicated insight and
careful thinking. These articles made such a favorable
impression on Bj&#246;rnson that he offered to secure
him the editorship of a Christiania daily. But
Lie was unwilling. He had made arrangements to
practise law at Kongsvinger, not far from the capital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
After a year's work in the new field, he married
a cousin, Thomasine Lie, to whom he had long been
betrothed. Together they had planned that he was
to be an author, and his hasty decision to become
a lawyer was a severe shock to her. From the beginning
she had faith in his literary possibilities; and
it was evidently her steady hand on the rudder,
throughout a long life, that guided the bark of his
genius through many dangerous reefs. But for her
good sense and loving loyalty, there would probably
not have been a Jonas Lie in Norwegian literature.
He often remarked that her name might
well appear on the title-page of most of his books.
In this most interesting partnership, his was the
creative spirit, hers the practical guiding hand.</p>

<p>Lie's new home was in the heart of a rich timber
district, which at that time was at the high tide of
a tremendous business boom. Here he achieved immediate
success as a lawyer. Moreover, through an
influential friend, he became the financial agent of
two banking houses in the capital. This gave him
the opportunity&mdash;and he had the necessary courage&mdash;to
take a hand in bold business enterprises
on a large scale. He prospered; the future seemed
roseate; he began to dream of such affluence as to
enable him to devote himself to literature. Meanwhile
he wrote verses for all manner of occasions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
and even published a volume of these poems (1866).
Both he and his wife had unusual social qualifications.
She was a fine musician, a woman of character
and much intellectual force, and a most competent
housewife. In this home of culture many prominent
men were entertained&mdash;first of all, Ole Bull, whom
Lie adored. Mighty schemes for the glorification
of Mother Norway were discussed as these two
"visionaries" sat brewing their toddy. Bj&#246;rnson,
too, was often there, and Sverdrup, the statesman.</p>

<p>Meanwhile clouds ominous of disaster appeared
on the commercial horizon. The period 1865&ndash;68
witnessed the greatest financial panic that Norway
had ever experienced. Lie had forebodings of a
catastrophe, but too late to save himself. He had
been lavish with his signature, and was tremendously
involved. The crash meant more than life
and death to him. It was a matter of honor, integrity,
conscience. He lost everything, and was in
debt to the extent of over $200,000. Lie, the lawyer,
was ruined. He resolved to return to literature, for
instinct urged him with "almost explosive force,"
to use his own phrase. As for his financial obligations,
he made a monumental resolution, as did
Walter Scott in a similar predicament, to pay every
dollar through his authorship; and for years he
dropped every penny that he did not absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
need into that abyss of debt. Friends finally convinced
him of the hopelessness of his purpose. With
what a heavy heart Lie carried the tale of his bankruptcy
to his faithful wife several of his novels testify.
Financial crashes play no small part in his
writings, and the pathetic force with which these
situations are handled sounds a distinctly personal
note.</p>

<p>With wife and children Lie returned to Christiania
in the autumn of 1868&mdash;empty-handed.
How he managed to keep his head above water by
the aid of loyal friends like Bj&#246;rnson, Sverdrup,
whose private secretary he was for a time, and old
Heltberg, of the Student Factory, who came to
engage him as a teacher of rhetoric and composition,
is an interesting story which need not be told
here. But through all his trials one determination
was fixed and inflexible: he would make literature
his life-work. It was not long before his thoughts
reverted to his early experiences in Nordland. After
several years of subjection to the stern reality of
legal and commercial enterprise, the Finn was again
asserting himself. His first novel, <i>Second Sight</i>, was
the result. He read it to his wife; she thought it
magnificent, but later applied the pruning-knife
drastically. Then Bj&#246;rnson was called in. He concurred
in the wife's opinion, and immediately wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
the great Copenhagen publisher, Hegel, pronouncing
the novel a "sea-mew" that would fly over all
the Scandinavian North, and urging hasty publication.
This was in November, 1870. By Christmas
the book was in the shops. In large part it purports
to be the autobiography of a visionary Nordlander,
who tells of his beloved home, and recounts marvellous
stories of the Arctic north; but through this
bead-string of episodes and descriptions there is interwoven
a pathetic tale of love, love so tender, so
delicate, that the words describing it seem to come
tripping on tiptoe. Unpromising as the novel
seems in the beginning, when one almost expects
a study in the pathology of second sight, it nevertheless
develops into such beauty as to make it the
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> of Scandinavian literature.</p>

<p>Every step of Jonas Lie's development from this
first novel to <i>The Family at Gilje</i> (1883) is of interest
to the student of literature. It was a period of
hard study, careful, conscientious work, and high
resolve to master his powers and to utilize his varied
experiences for literary purposes, in order to be
able to serve Mother Norway,&mdash;for one must never
forget the intense patriotic ardor of all Norway's
great writers, artists, and musicians. By the aid of
a government stipend, Lie was enabled to visit
Nordland and the western coast to promote his literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
production, and soon afterward a second and
larger stipend for the purpose of foreign travel
made it possible for him to visit Rome, the Mecca
of all Scandinavian artists and <i>literati</i> of the period.
There he remained more than three years, a time of
fruitful toil and stimulating experience. In 1872 he
sent home two books relating to life on the western
and northern coast, <i>The Good Ship Future</i>, and
a collection of short stories.</p>

<p>Lie was not content, however, to be "the poet of
Nordland," as he at once had been named. His
ambition was to be more national. In the broader
realms of literary activity the giant figures of Ibsen
and Bj&#246;rnson towered. They were deep in the problems
of the day. How could he become national
and modern? Instinct led him on in paths that unconsciously
he had already trodden. In this nation
of seafarers he was the first in modern literature to
discover the coast-dwellers and to portray their
struggles on the sea. His first book contained a description
of a storm in northern waters that makes
the reader hold his breath. In the volume of short
stories, which in their scenes sweep along the western
coast, and in <i>The Good Ship Future</i> as well, there
was a distinct odor of the sea. This was natural
enough: he had spent his early years in Nordland
and in Bergen, the centre of Norwegian shipping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>
and he loved the sea passionately. In his next novel,
<i>The Pilot and his Wife</i>, he put to sea with sails
hoisted to the top.</p>

<p>The critics apparently had not felt the sea-breezes
in his first books; but in the last there blew such
a lusty gale that all, both critics and public, sniffed
its fresh and salty breath with keenest relish. The
book was a success, which his previous novel had
not quite been, and it marks the beginning of Lie's
sane and natural realism as consciously applied, in
its main problem, to a modern social question, making
the story, in its essence, a novel of character,
a psychological study of the relation of man and
wife, and not primarily a novel of adventure, which
assumption gave Lie the designation "novelist of
the sea." The success of the book brought the author,
in 1874, by vote of the Storting, a life stipend
known as a "poet's salary," which recognition put
him in a class with Ibsen and Bj&#246;rnson. The great
honor seems to have had a depressing effect, for
Lie now scored four failures in succession. He was
back in Norway, trying to portray social phenomena
of the capital city. The reviewers were most irritating
and offensive, and he felt obliged temporarily to
desert the field. With the novel <i>Rutland</i> (1881), he
returned to the sea. This story surpasses <i>The Pilot</i>
in every respect. The sea is described with the fondness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>
of a lover. Like <i>The Pilot</i>, it also deals with
a problem of the home, but what chiefly impressed
the public in reading the book was that the seamen,
that important element of the Norwegian people,
had found an adequate interpreter.</p>

<p>His next book, <i>Forward (Gaa Paa)</i> (1882), was
likewise a maritime novel, with panoramas in the
life of the fisher folk on the western coast. At the
same time it forecast the new age of industrial development,
and revealed growing sympathy and increased
understanding in matters of national import.
The author seems to have become convinced
that a novelist, too, might be able to lend a hand in
paving the way for progress. In this book he had by
his vivid portrayal attacked stagnation, superstition,
sluggishness, and had proclaimed the new gospel of
work, activity, enterprise. It had been begun during
the latter part of a three years' sojourn in Germany.
It was completed in Norway during the autumn
of 1882, after which Lie took up his abode in
Paris, where he made his home for many years.</p>

<p>For his next work, <i>A Life Prisoner</i> (1883), Lie
found his theme in the slums of Christiania. The
treatment was not naturalistic enough to satisfy the
critics. Lie was of course not unmindful of the new
literary movement, but he possessed then, as always,
sufficient individual momentum to carry him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>
through the ephemeral phases of literary fads. His
novels are not barometers of the prevailing literary
atmosphere. He believed in a realism of true naturalism,
which has stood the test of time. In this last
work he brings a waif of modern society close to the
hearts of his readers, and needs no explosions of
pent-up indignation, no spirit of class hatred, to
make his readers understand this unfortunate product
of a bad environment. In his reply to the critics,
Lie spoke forcibly on the new literary method,
summing up his views in these words: "The main
thing is to picture life so that the reader sees, hears,
feels, comprehends it; by what esthetic means this
is accomplished must be the author's own affair in
each individual case. But experience has shown that
of all methods direct ones are often the least effective.
A single deft touch may save a dozen pages of
detailed description." Lie was not a student of the
base; he did not even have an artistic liking for evil.
There are few bad characters in his works.</p>

<p>It was immediately after his controversy with the
critics, in 1883, that <i>The Family at Gilje</i> appeared&mdash;a
superb illustration of Lie's realism of naturalness.
An American critic has said of good realistic writing
that it does not so much arouse the pleasure of surprise
as that of recognition. To intelligent Norwegian
readers of the day that was strikingly true of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
<i>The Family at Gilje</i>. To many readers it seemed like
living their lives over again. This may not be a very
severe test of the greatness of a novel. Greatness will
depend upon other things&mdash;the breadth and depth
of its humanity. Another point: "The right understanding
of men and women leads to the right relations
of men and women, and in this way a novel
may do good" (F. Marion Crawford). Most of Lie's
novels seem to have been written with this object in
view. It is evident that in an attempt to portray life
for this purpose, social and other questions are sure
to appear&mdash;not thrust into the reader's face as a
problem demanding that he take sides, but brought
to his attention naturally, as such things ordinarily
come in life. Discreetly done, as Lie surely could do
it, this may be a most effective way of revolutionizing
conscience. In this artistic manner Lie was, and
no doubt consciously, a reformer. To be sure, this
is not art for art's sake; it is something more human:
art engaged in the pursuit of stimulating noble and
healthful thought for the purpose of raising the
average of human happiness.</p>

<p>It was this calm and restrained realistic method
that Lie now applied in a series of novels which
succeeded <i>The Family at Gilje</i>. As in this work, the
scenes are usually laid in a preceding generation,
preferably among the official class in the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
In these homes, which Lie knew so well, we feel that
we are with real and natural people among whom
problems are not discussed, but experienced. Yet
these novels were not so conservative as they seemed.
They had persuasive power in behalf of modern ideas
with respect to such fundamental things as marriage,
home, and children. There was even something of
the essence of social dynamite in some of them. <i>The
Family at Gilje</i> gave the champions of women new
arguments, but they could not approve of the
author's advanced sympathies in <i>The Commodore's
Daughters</i>, one of the realistic novels which now
flowed from Lie's pen and which included: <i>A Maelstrom</i>
(1884), <i>The Commodore's Daughters</i> (1885),
<i>A Wedded Life</i> (1887), <i>Maisa Jons</i> (1888), and <i>Evil
Powers</i> (1890). Suddenly there came a change in
his literary method, seemingly induced by some
unpleasant experience with good friends. He had
learned that the conduct of the best of men is often
swayed by primal instinct rather than by disciplined
reason. In this mood he reverted to the trusty Finn
of his bosom who so long had lain dormant, and
let him discourse on life and human nature. He
proved voluble, resourceful, and original. The result
was published in two volumes (1891 and 1892), entitled
<i>Trold</i>. They are, in part, phantasmagorias
charged with the symbolism of Norse legendary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>
lore, where trolls are the personified manifestation
of evil forces in nature. The opening sentence of
the illuminating introduction says: "That there are
trolls in human beings every one knows who has an
eye for that sort of thing."</p>

<p>In the most characteristic of these stories, of
which there are a dozen in each volume, Lie has personified
primal instincts,&mdash;allegorized some of the
strange facts and mystic forces of nature, man, and
society. Others are in lighter vein and have a more
human cast, being mere playful satires on social
phenomena. They form a marvellous medley. At
first it seems quite impossible to believe that the
author of <i>The Family at Gilje</i> can be the begetter
of things so fantastic and grotesque. But when the
reader thinks of the early Nordland stories, he understands,
and then feels inclined to regret, that the
Finn had so long lain dormant. One is tempted to
believe that a little of the troll element could easily
have been used to give a tinge of terror to his calm
realism; and this is in fact what he has done most
effectively in the novel <i>Dyre Rein</i> (1896), which in
other respects much resembles <i>The Family at Gilje</i>.</p>

<p>After the publication of <i>Trold</i>, Lie, even where
he does not introduce troll effects, is not hesitant
about using more tragic methods and more dramatic
scenes than during the period of the strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>
realistic novels. There is, moreover, a decided trend
toward a wider scope and more cosmopolitan aims,
as in <i>When the Iron Curtain Falls</i> (1901), a bolder
symbolism, as in <i>Niobe</i> (1893) and in his last work,
<i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon, and Beyond the
Towers of Babylon</i> (1905), in which, however, as the
title indicates, the story is top-heavy with symbolism.
It runs parallel with the main narrative as an
introduction to each chapter. The whole is the tale
of a genius, hampered and harassed by malicious
trolls in human guise&mdash;evidently an adumbration
of the author's own personal experience. But he is,
as always, charitable: "Human nature is so complex!"</p>

<p>In other words: the last fifteen years of Lie's
authorship reveal him in full possession of the realistic
powers of the preceding period, illuminated by
a profound comprehension of the mystic forces of
life that so often determine human fates.</p>

<p class="p3t">Like Ibsen, Lie lived abroad for many years, mainly
in Paris, but usually spending his summers in
the Bavarian Alps, where most of his writing was
done. There were too many distractions in Paris,
where his home was a centre of the colony of Scandinavian
artists and literary workers. In the summer
of 1893, after an absence of ten years, he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">xxx</a></span>
the need of visiting Norway again. An intense feeling
of homesickness had seized him, as the following
incident will indicate. He had called on a Norwegian
family in Paris who had just received a plant
from Norway in Norwegian earth. "Thinking himself
unobserved," one of his daughters tells, "I saw
him turn from the company, take a pinch of that
earth and put it to his mouth. Whether he kissed
it or ate it I do not know. But he looked very solemn."</p>

<p>In Norway he was received most cordially. On
the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, Brandes proclaimed
him "the most amiable of geniuses." He
was interviewed, banqueted, and serenaded almost
to distraction, and was glad to get back to Paris,
happy, however, in having experienced the touching
devotion of his countrymen. A decade of arduous
toil followed, after which he began to make plans
for returning to Norway to spend the last years of
his life. A cozy home was built at Fredriksv&#230;rn, on
the southern coast, and in 1906 the family took
possession of it. The next year, however, his faithful
wife, the guardian of his genius, passed away.
Dependent upon her companionship and solicitous
care, he did not long survive her. He died July 5,
1908.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Storting took fitting cognizance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</a></span>
of his death, and, as had been done at Ibsen's demise,
decreed that interment should be made at the
expense of the State.</p>

<p>"Blessed are the merciful," said the pastor at his
bier.</p>

<p>"Be merciful!" is the sentiment that echoes and
re&#235;choes throughout Jonas Lie's pages.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was a clear, cold afternoon in the mountain
region. The air lay blue with the frost, with
light rose tints over all the sharp crests, ravines,
and peaks, which, like a series of gigantic drifts,
tower above tower, floated up towards the horizon.
Below, hills and wooded mountain slopes shut the
region in with white walls, constantly narrower and
narrower, nearer and nearer, always more contracting.</p>

<p>The snow was late this year, but in return, now
that the Christmas season had come, lay so heavy
on fir and spruce that it bent down both needles
and twigs. The groves of birches stood up to their
waists in snow; the small clusters of tile-roofed
houses of the district were half buried, with snow-drifts
pressing down over the roofs. The entrances
to the farmyards were deeply dug paths, from which
the gate and fence posts stuck up here and there
like the masts of sunken boats.</p>

<p>The snow-plough had recently gone through the
highway, and on the steep red-tiled roof of the
captain's house men were busy shovelling down the
great frozen snow-drifts, which hung threatening
over the ends of the roof.</p>

<p>The captain's house was specially prominent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the district. It was unpainted and built of square
logs, like the greater part of that kind of houses a
generation ago.</p>

<p>Over the garden fence and almost up under the
window-frames lay the snow-drifts with tracks of
sleds and skis in their icy crust, which smoked a
little in the frosty north wind under the sun.</p>

<p>It was the same cold, disagreeable north wind
which, every time the outer door was opened, blew
against the kitchen door until that opened too, and,
if it was not closed again, soon after, one or another
door on the next floor,&mdash;and that made the captain
come down from his office, flushed and passionate,
to make inquiries and fret and fume over the whole
house as to who had gone there first and who had
gone last. He could never understand why they did
not keep the door shut, though the matter was most
easily to be understood,&mdash;for the latch was old and
loose, and the captain would never spend any money
on the smith for a new one.</p>

<p>In the common room below, between the sofa
and the stove, the captain's wife, in an old brown
linsey-woolsey dress, sat sewing. She had a tall, stiff
figure, and a strong, but gaunt, dried-up face, and
had the appearance of being anxiously occupied at
present by an intricate problem&mdash;the possibility of
again being able to put a new durable patch on the
seat of J&#246;rgen's trousers; they were always bottomless&mdash;almost
to desperation.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>She had just seized the opportunity for this, while
J&#228;ger was up in his office, and the children were gone
to the post-office; for she went about all day long
like a horse grinding clay in a brickyard.</p>

<p>The mahogany sewing-table inlaid with mother-of-pearl
and several different kinds of wood, which
stood open before her, must have been a family
heirloom; in its condition of faded antiquity, it reminded
one not a little of her, and in any event did
not at all correspond either with the high-backed,
rickety, leather armchair, studded with brass nails,
in which she sat, nor with the long birchen sofa covered
with green linsey-woolsey, which stood like a
solitary deserted land against the wall, and seemed
to look longingly over to the brown, narrow folding-table,
which, with its leaves let down, stood equally
solitary and abandoned between the two windows.</p>

<p>The brown case with the four straight legs against
the farther wall, with a heap of papers, books, hats,
and the spy-glass upon it, was an old clavichord,
which, with great trouble, she had had transported
up into the mountain region, out of the effects of
her home, and on which she had faithfully practised
with her children the same pieces which she herself
had learned.</p>

<p>The immense every-day room, with the bare timber
walls, the unpainted sanded floor, and the small
panes with short curtains fastened up in the middle,
was in its whole extent extremely scantily furnished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
it was half a mile from chair to chair, and
everything had a rural meagreness such as one could
often see in the homes of officials in the mountain
districts in the forties. In the middle of the inner
wall, before the great white fire-wall, the antique
stove with the Naes iron-works stamp and the
knotty wooden logs under it jutted out into the
room like a mighty giant. Indeed, nothing less than
such a mass of iron was needed to succeed in warming
up the room; and in the woods of the captain's
farm there was plenty of fuel.</p>

<p>Finally abandoning all more delicate expedients
for the trousers, she had laid on a great patch covering
everything, and was now sewing zealously.
The afternoon sun was still shedding a pale yellow
light in the window-frames; it was so still in the
room that her movements in sewing were almost
audible, and a spool of thread which fell down
caused a kind of echo.</p>

<p>All at once she raised herself like a soldier at an
order and gave attention. She heard her husband's
quick, heavy step creaking on the stairs.</p>

<p>Was it the outside door again?</p>

<p>Captain J&#228;ger, a red, round, and stout man in a
threadbare uniform coat, came hastily in, puffing,
with the still wet quill-pen in his mouth; he went
straight to the window.</p>

<p>His wife merely sewed more rapidly; she wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
to use the time, and also prudently to assume the
defensive against what might come.</p>

<p>He breathed on the frosty pane in order to enlarge
the part that could be seen through. "You will
see there is something by the mail. The children are
running a race down there in the road,&mdash;they are
running away from J&#246;rgen with the sled."</p>

<p>The needle only flew still faster.</p>

<p>"Ah, how they run!&mdash;Thinka and Thea. But
Inger-Johanna! Come here, Ma, and see how she
puts down her feet&mdash;isn't it as if she was dancing?
Now she means to be the first in, and so she will be
the first, that I promise you. It is no story when I
tell you that the lass is handsome, Ma; that they
all see. Ah, come and look how she gets ahead of
Thinka! Just come now, Ma!"</p>

<p>But "Ma" did not stir. The needle moved with
forced nervous haste. The captain's wife was sewing
a race with what was coming; it was even possible
that she might get the last of the patch finished before
they entered, and just now the sun disappeared
behind the mountain crest; they were short days it
gave them up there.</p>

<p>The steps outside were taken in two or three
leaps, and the door flew open.</p>

<p>Quite right&mdash;Inger-Johanna.</p>

<p>She rushed in with her cloak unfastened and covered
with snow. She had untied the strings of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
hood on the way up the steps, so that her black hair
fell down in confusion over her hot face. Breathless,
she threw her flowered Valders mittens on a chair.
She stood a moment to get her breath, brushed her
hair under her hood, and shouted out:</p>

<p>"An order for post-horses at the station, for Captain
R&#246;nnow and Lieutenant Mein. The horses are
to be here at Gilje at six o'clock to-morrow morning.
They are coming here."</p>

<p>"R&#246;nnow, Ma!" roared the captain, surprised; it
was one of the comrades of his youth.</p>

<p>Now the others also came storming in with the
details.</p>

<p>The mother's pale face, with its marked features
and smooth black hair in loops down over her cheeks
in front of her cap, assumed a somewhat thoughtful,
anxious expression. Should the veal roast be
sacrificed which she had reserved for the dean, or
the pig? The latter had been bought from the north
district, and was fearfully poor.</p>

<p>"Well, well, I bet he is going to Stockholm,"
continued the captain, meditatively drumming on
the window-frame. "Adjutant, perhaps; they would
not let that fellow stay out there in the West. Do
you know, Ma, I have thought of something of
this sort ever since the prince had so much to do
with him at the drill-ground. I often said to him,
'Your stories, R&#246;nnow, will make your fortune,&mdash;but
look out for the general, he knows a thing or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
two.' 'Pooh! that goes down like hot cakes,' said
he. And it looks like it&mdash;the youngest captain!"</p>

<p>"The prince&mdash;" The captain's wife was just
through with the trousers, and rose hastily. Her
meagre, yellowish face, with its Roman nose, assumed
a resolute expression: she decided on the
fatted calf.</p>

<p>"Inger-Johanna, see to it that your father has
his Sunday wig on," she exclaimed hurriedly, and
hastened out into the kitchen.</p>

<p>The stove in the best room was soon packed full,
and glowing. It had not been used since it had been
rubbed up and polished with blacking last spring,
and smoked now so that they were obliged to open
door and windows to the cold, though it was below
zero.</p>

<p>Great-Ola, the farm-hand, had been busy carrying
large armfuls of long wood into the kitchen, and
afterwards with brushing the captain's old uniform
coat with snow out on the porch; it must not look
as if he had dressed up.</p>

<p>The guest-chamber was made ready, with the
beds turned down, and the fire started, so that the
thin stove snapped, and the flies suddenly woke up
and buzzed under the ceiling, while the wainscot
was browned outside of the fire-wall and smelled of
paint. J&#246;rgen's hair was wet and combed; the girls
changed their aprons to be ready to go down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
greet the guests, and were set to work rolling up
pipe-lighters for the card-table.</p>

<p>They kept looking out as long as the twilight
lasted, both from the first and second story windows,
while Great-Ola, with his red peaked cap,
made a path in the snow to the carriage-road and
the steps.</p>

<p>And now, when it was dark, the children listened
with beating hearts for the slightest sound from
the road. All their thoughts and longings went out
towards the strange, distant world which so rarely
visited them, but of which they heard so much that
sounded grand and marvellous.</p>

<p>There are the bells!</p>

<p>But, no; Thinka was entirely wrong.</p>

<p>They had all agreed to that fact, when Inger-Johanna,
who stood in the dark by a window which
she held a little open, exclaimed, "But there they
are!"</p>

<p>Quite right. They could hear the sleigh-bells, as
the horse, moving by fits and starts, laboriously
made his way up the Gilje hills.</p>

<p>The outside door was opened, and Great-Ola
stood at the stairs, holding the stable lantern with
a tallow candle in it, ready to receive them.</p>

<p>A little waiting, and the bells suddenly sounded
plainly in the road behind the wood-shed. Now you
could hear the snow creaking under the runners.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>The captain placed the candlestick on the table
in the hall, the floor of which had been freshly
scoured, washed, and strewn with juniper. He went
out on the stairs, while the children, head to head,
peeped out of the kitchen door, and kept Pasop,
who growled and fretted behind them, from rushing
out and barking.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, R&#246;nnow! Good-evening, Lieutenant!
Welcome to Gilje!" said the captain with
his strong, cheerful voice, while the vehicle, which
at the last post-house was honored with the name
of double sleigh, swung into the yard and up to the
steps. "You are elegantly equipped, I see."</p>

<p>"Beastly cold, Peter,&mdash;beastly cold, Peter," came
the answer from the tall figure wrapped in furs, as
he threw down the reins, and, now a little stiff in his
movements, stepped out of the sleigh, while the
steaming horse shook himself in his harness so that
the bells rang loudly. "I believe we are frozen stiff.
And then this little rat we have for a horse would
not go. It is a badger dog they have harnessed in
order to dig our way through the snow-drifts. How
are you, Peter? It will be pleasant to get into your
house. How goes it?" he concluded, upon the steps,
shaking the captain's hand. "Bring in the case of
bottles, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>While the two gentlemen took off their furs and
travelling-boots in the hall and paid for the horse,
and Great-Ola carried the trunk up to the guest-chamber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
an odor of incense diffused itself from the
large room, which at once roused Captain R&#246;nnow's
cavalier instinct to a recollection of the lady, whom,
in the joy of seeing his old comrade once more,
he had forgotten. His large, stately figure stopped
before the door, and he adjusted his stock.</p>

<p>"Do I look tolerably well, Peter, so I can properly
appear before your wife?" he said, running his
hand through his black curly hair.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, fine enough&mdash;devilish fine-looking
fellow, Lieutenant.&mdash;If you please, gentlemen.
Captain R&#246;nnow and Lieutenant Mein, Ma," he
said, as he opened the door.</p>

<p>The mistress of the house rose from her place at
the table, where she was now sitting with fine white
knitting-work. She greeted Captain R&#246;nnow as
heartily as her stiff figure would allow, and the
lieutenant somewhat critically. It was the governor's
sister to whom the salaam was made, as Captain
R&#246;nnow afterwards expressed it&mdash;an old, great
family.</p>

<p>She disappeared a little later into domestic affairs,
to "get them something for supper."</p>

<p>Captain R&#246;nnow rubbed his hands from the cold,
wheeled around on one leg on the floor, and thus
placed himself with his back to the stove. "I tell
you we are frozen stiff, Peter,&mdash;but&mdash;Oh, Lieutenant,
bring in the case of bottles."</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Mein came in again, R&#246;nnow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
took a sealed bottle with a label, and held it, swinging
by the neck, before the captain.</p>

<p>"Look at it, Peter J&#228;ger! Look well at it!" and
he moved over towards his friend. "Genuine arrack
from Atschin in hither&mdash;farther&mdash;East&mdash;or West
India. I present it to you. May it melt your heart,
Peter J&#228;ger!"</p>

<p>"Hot water and sugar, Ma!" shouted the captain
out into the kitchen, "then we shall soon know
whether you only mean to deceive us simple country
folks with stories. And out with the whist-table
till we have supper! We can play three-handed
whist with a dummy."</p>

<p>"Brrr-rr-whew, what kind of stuff is it you've
got in your tobacco box, J&#228;ger?" said Captain R&#246;nnow,
who was filling his pipe at it; "powder, sneezing
powder, I believe! Smell it, Lieutenant. It must
be tansy from the nursery."</p>

<p>"Tideman's three crown, fellow! We can't endure
your leaf tobacco and Virginia up here in the
mountain districts," came from J&#228;ger, who was pulling
out and opening the card-table. "Only look at
the next box under the lead cover, and you will find
some cut-leaf tobacco, Bremen leaf, as black and
high flavored as you want. Up here it is only to the
goats that we can offer that kind, and to the folk
who come from Bergen; they use strong tobacco
there to dry out the wet fog."</p>

<p>The door opened, and the three girls and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
little brother came in, carrying the tray with the
glasses and the jug of hot water, which task they
seemed to have apportioned among themselves
according to the rules for the procession at the
Duke of Marlborough's funeral, where, as is known,
the fourth one carried nothing.</p>

<p>The tall, blond Kathinka marched at the head
with the tray and glasses with the clinking teaspoons
in them. She attempted the feat of curtseying,
while she was carrying the tray, and blushed
red when it was ready to slip, and the lieutenant
was obliged to take hold of it to steady it.</p>

<p>He immediately noticed the next oldest, a brunette
with long eyelashes, who was coming with the
smoking water-jug on a plate, while the youngest,
Thea, was immediately behind her with the sugar-bowl.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Peter J&#228;ger," exclaimed R&#246;nnow,
astonished at the appearance of his friend's almost
grown-up daughters, "when have you picked up all
this? You wrote once about some girls,&mdash;and a boy
who was to be baptized."</p>

<p>At the same moment J&#246;rgen came boldly forward,
strutting over the floor, and made his best
bow, while he pulled his bristly yellow locks instead
of his cap.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"J&#246;rgen Winnecken von Zittow J&#228;ger."</p>

<p>"That was heavy! You are a perfect mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
boy, are you not? Let me see you kick as high as
your name."</p>

<p>"No, but as high as my cap," answered J&#246;rgen,
going back on the floor and turning a cart-wheel.</p>

<p>"Bold fellow, that J&#246;rgen!" And with that, as
J&#246;rgen had done his part, he stepped back into obscurity.
But while the gentlemen were pouring out
the arrack punch at the folding-table, he kept his
eyes uninterruptedly fastened on Lieutenant Mein.
It was the lieutenant's regularly trimmed black
moustache, which seemed to him like bits that he
had not got into his mouth properly.</p>

<p>"Oh, here, my girl!" said R&#246;nnow, turning to
one of the daughters, who stood by his side while
he was putting some sugar into the steaming glass,
"what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Inger-Johanna."</p>

<p>"Yes, listen"&mdash;he spoke without seeing anything
else than the arm he touched to call her attention.
"Listen, my little Inger-Johanna! In the
breast pocket of my fur coat out in the hall there
are two lemons&mdash;I didn't believe that fruit grew
up here in the mountains, Peter!&mdash;two lemons."</p>

<p>"No, let me! Pardon me!" and the lieutenant
flew gallantly.</p>

<p>Captain R&#246;nnow looked up, astonished. The
dark, thin girl, in the outgrown dress which hung
about her legs, and the three thick, heavy, black
cables, braided closely for the occasion, hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
down her back, stood distinct in the light before
him. Her neck rose, delicately shaped and dazzlingly
fresh, from the blue, slightly low-cut, linsey-woolsey
dress, and carried her head proudly,
with a sort of swan-like curve.</p>

<p>The captain grasped at once why the lieutenant
was so alert.</p>

<p>"Bombs and grenades, Peter!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, Ma?" the captain grunted
slyly.</p>

<p>"Up here among the peasants the children&mdash;more's
the pity&mdash;grow up without any other manners
than those that they learn of the servants,"
sighed the mother. "Don't stand so bent over,
Thinka, straighten up."</p>

<p>Thinka straightened up her overgrown blond
figure and tried to smile. She had the difficult task
of hiding a plaster on one side of her chin, where
a day or two before she had fallen down through
the cellar trap-door in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Soon the three gentlemen sat comfortably at their
cards, each one smoking his pipe and with a glass of
hot arrack punch by his side. Two moulded tallow
candles in tall brass candlesticks stood on the card-table
and two on the folding-table; they illuminated
just enough so that you could see the almanac, which
hung down by a piece of twine from a nail under
the looking-glass, and a part of the lady's tall form
and countenance, while she sat knitting in her frilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
cap. In the darkness of the room the chairs farthest
off by the stove could hardly be distinguished from
the kitchen door&mdash;from which now and then came
the hissing of the roasting meat.</p>

<p>"Three tricks, as true as I live&mdash;three tricks,
and by those cards!" exclaimed Captain R&#246;nnow,
eager in the game.</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks," turning to Inger-Johanna
who brought a lighted paper-lighter to his expiring
pipe. "Th-a-nks"&mdash;he continued, drawing in
the smoke and puffing it out, his observant eyes
again being attracted by her. Her expression was so
bright, the great dark eyes moving to and fro under
her eyebrows like dark drops, while she stood following
the cards.</p>

<p>"What is your name, once more, my girl?" he
asked absently.</p>

<p>"Inger-Johanna," she replied with a certain humor;
she avoided looking at him.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes.&mdash;Now it is my turn to deal! Your
daughter puts a bee in my bonnet, madam. I should
like to take her with me to Christiania to the governor's,
and bring her out. We would make a tremendous
sensation, that I am sure of."</p>

<p>"At last properly dealt! Play."</p>

<p>With her hands on the back of her father's chair,
Inger-Johanna gazed intently on the cards; but her
face had a heightened glow.</p>

<p>R&#246;nnow glanced at her from one side. "A sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
for the gods, a sight for the gods!" he exclaimed, as
he gathered together with his right hand the cards
he had just arranged, and threw them on the table.
"Naturally I mean how the lieutenant manages
dummy&mdash;you understand, madam," nodding to her
with significance. "Heavens! Peter, that was a card
to play.&mdash;Here you can see what I mean," he continued.
"Trump, trump, trump, trump!" He eagerly
threw four good spades on the table, one after
another, without paying any attention to what followed.</p>

<p>The expression of the lady's face, as she sat there
and heard her innermost thoughts repeated so
plainly, was immovably sealed; she said, somewhat
indifferently, "It is high time, children, you said
good-night; it is past your bed-time. Say good-night
to the gentlemen."</p>

<p>The command brought disappointment to their
faces; not obeying was out of the question, and they
went round the table, and made curtsies and shook
hands with the captain and the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The last thing J&#246;rgen noticed was that the lieutenant
turned round, stretched his neck, and gaped
like Svarten as they went out.</p>

<p>Their mother straightened up over her knitting-work.
"You used to visit my brother's, the governor's,
formerly, Captain R&#246;nnow," she ventured.
"They are childless folk, who keep a hospitable
house. You will call on them now, I suppose."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly I shall! To refrain from doing that
would be a crime! You have, I should imagine,
thought of sending one of your daughters there.
The governor's wife is a person who knows how to
introduce a young lady into the world, and your
Inger-Johanna&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain's wife answered slowly and with
some stress; something of a suppressed bitterness
rose up in her. "That would be an entirely unexpected
piece of good fortune; but more than we out-of-the-way
country folk can expect of our grand,
distinguished sister-in-law. Small circumstances
make small folk, more's the pity; large ones ought
to make them otherwise.&mdash;My brother has made
her a happy wife."</p>

<p>"Done. Will you allow an old friend to work a
little for your attractive little Inger?" returned Captain
R&#246;nnow.</p>

<p>"I think that Ma will thank you. What do you
say, Gitta? Then you will have a peg to hang one
of them on. It can't be from one of us two that Inger-Johanna
has inherited her beauty, Ma!" said
Captain J&#228;ger, coughing and warding off his wife's
admonitory look; "but there is blood, both on her
father's and mother's side. Her great-grandmother
was married off up in Norway by the Danish queen
because she was too handsome to be at court&mdash;it
was your grandmother, Ma! Fr&#246;ken von&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear J&#228;ger," begged his wife.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>"Pshaw, Ma! The sand of many years has been
strewed over that event."</p>

<p>When the game was again started, the captain's
wife went with her knitting-work to the card-table,
snuffed first one candle and then the other, leaned
over her husband, and whispered something.</p>

<p>The captain looked up, rather surprised. "Yes,
indeed, Ma! Yes, indeed&mdash;'My camel for your
dromedary,' said Peter Vangensten, when he
swapped his old spavined horse for Mamen's
blooded foal. If you come with your arrack from
Holland and farther India, then I put my red wine
direct from France against it&mdash;genuine Bordeaux,
brought home and drawn straight from the hogshead!
There were just two dozen the governor sent
us with the wagon the autumn J&#246;rgen was baptized.&mdash;The
two farthest to the left, Ma! You had better
take Marit with you with the lantern. Then you
can tell the governor's wife that we drank her health
up here among the snow-drifts, R&#246;nnow."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is very susceptible to that kind of thing,
Peter J&#228;ger."</p>

<p>When the captain's wife came in again, she had
the stiff damask tablecloth on her arm, and was accompanied
by a girl who helped move the folding-table
out on the floor. It was to be set for supper,
and the card-table must be moved into the best
room, across the hall, which was now warm.</p>

<p>"Can you wait, Ma, till the rubber is played?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>Ma did not answer; but they felt the full pressure
of her silence; her honor was at stake&mdash;the roast
veal.</p>

<p>And they played on silently, but at a tearing pace
as with full steam.</p>

<p>Finally the captain exclaimed, while Ma stood
immovable with the cloth in the middle of the floor,
"There, there, we must get away, R&#246;nnow!"</p>

<p class="p3t">In the chamber above, impatient hearts were hammering
and beating.</p>

<p>While J&#246;rgen went to sleep with the image before
him of his lieutenant who gaped like Svarten
when he came out of the stable door into the light,
and after Torbj&#246;rg had put out the candle, the sisters
stole out into the great, cold, dark hall. There
they all three stood, leaning over the balustrade,
and gazing down on the fur coats and mufflers,
which hung on the timber wall, and on the whip
and the two sabre sheaths and the case of bottles,
which were dimly lighted by the stable lantern on
the hall table.</p>

<p>They smelt the odor of the roast as it came up,
warm and appetizing, and saw when the guests, each
with his punch-glass in his hand and with flickering
candle, went across the hall into the large room.
They heard the folding-table moved out and set, and
later caught the sound of the clinking of glasses,
laughter, and loud voices.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>Every sound from below was given a meaning,
every fragment of speech was converted into a romance
for their thirsty fancy.</p>

<p>They stood there in the cold till their teeth chattered
and their limbs shook against the wood-work,
so that they were obliged to get into bed again to
thaw out.</p>

<p>They heard how the chairs made a noise when
the guests rose from the table, and they went out in
the hall again, Thinka and Inger-Johanna,&mdash;Thea
was asleep. It helped a little when they put their
feet upon the lowest rail of the balustrade, or hung
over it with their legs bent double under them.</p>

<p>Thinka held out because Inger-Johanna held
out; but finally she was compelled to give up, she
could not feel her legs any more. And now Inger-Johanna
alone hung down over the balustrade.</p>

<p>A sort of close odor of punch and tobacco smoke
frozen together rose up through the stairs in the
cold, and every time the door was opened and
showed the heavy, smoky, blue gleam of light in
the great room, she could hear officers' names, fragments
of laughter, of violent positive assertions,
with profane imprecations by all possible and impossible
powers of the heavens above and the earth
beneath, and between them her father's gay voice,&mdash;all
chopped off in mince-meat every time the
door was shut.</p>

<p>When Inger-Johanna went to bed again, she lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
thinking how Captain R&#246;nnow had asked her twice
what her name was, and then again how at the card-table
he had said, "I should like to take her with me
to the governor's wife; we would make a tremendous
sensation." And then what came next, "Naturally
I mean how the lieutenant plays dummy,"&mdash;which
they thought she did not understand.</p>

<p>The wind blew and howled around the corner
of the house, and whistled down through the
great plastered chimney-pipe in the hall&mdash;and she
still, half in her dreams, heard Captain R&#246;nnow's
"Trump! trump! trump! trump!"</p>

<p class="p3t">The next day Ma went about the house as usual
with her bunch of keys; she had hardly slept at all
that night.</p>

<p>She had become old before her time, like so
many other "mas," in the household affairs of that
period&mdash;old by bearing petty annoyances, by toil
and trouble, by never having money enough, by
bending and bowing, by continually looking like
nothing and being everything&mdash;the one on whom
the whole anxious care of the house weighed.</p>

<p>But&mdash;"One lives for the children."</p>

<p>That was Ma's pet sigh of consolation. And
the new time had not yet come to the "mas" with
the question whether they were not also bound to
realize their own personal lives.</p>

<p>But for the children it was a holiday, and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
after breakfast they darted into the great
room.</p>

<p>There stood the card-table, again moved against
the wall, with the cards thrown in a disorderly pile
over the paper on which the score had been kept.
It had been folded up and burned on one end for
a lighter; and by its side, during a preliminary
cleaning, the three pipes were lying, shoved aside.
One window was still open, notwithstanding the
wind blew in so that the fastening hook rattled.</p>

<p>There was something in the room&mdash;a pungent
odor, which was not good; no, but there was,
nevertheless, something about it&mdash;something of an
actual occurrence.</p>

<p>Outside of the window Great-Ola stood with his
hands on the shovel in the steep snow-drift, listening
to Marit's account of how the captain had left
a broad two-kroner piece for drink money on the
table up in the guest-chamber and the lieutenant a
shilling under the candlestick, and how the mistress
had divided them among the girls.</p>

<p>"The lieutenant was not so butter-fingered,"
suggested Marit.</p>

<p>"Don't you know that a lieutenant would be
shot if he gave as much as his captain, girl," retorted
Great-Ola, while she hurried in with the keys
of the storehouse and the meal-chest.</p>

<p>From the captain's sleeping-room the sound of
his snoring could be heard for the whole forenoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
The guests did not go to bed, and started at six
o'clock in the morning, when the post-boy came to
the door&mdash;after the second bottle, also, of R&#246;nnow's
Indian arrack had been emptied, and a
breakfast with whiskey, brawn, and the remnants
of the roast veal had strengthened them for the day's
journey.</p>

<p>But the thing to be done was to have a good
time on the holiday. The sisters bustled about in
the hall with their skis, and J&#246;rgen was trying how
the outer steps would do for a ski slide.</p>

<p>Soon they were out on the long steep hill behind
the cow-barn&mdash;the ski-staff in both hands in front
for a balance, their comforters streaming out behind
their necks. In the jump Inger-Johanna lost her
balance and almost&mdash;no, she kept up!</p>

<p>It was because she looked up to the window of
the sleeping-room to see if her father appreciated
her skill.</p>

<p>He was walking about and dressing. Ma had at
last, about dinner time, ventured to wake him up.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter II</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Two</span> days before Christmas Great-Ola with
Svarten and his load was expected from Christiania,
where he went twice a year, St. John's Day
and Christmas, for the household supplies. To-day
was the ninth day; but in sleighing like this, when
the horse's feet struck through at every step, no
one could be sure of anything.</p>

<p>The load, met on the run, far down the slippery,
slushy hill, by the children and the barking, one-eyed
Pasop, came along in the afternoon, while
Svarten, even in his exertions on the steep part of
the hill, neighed and whinnied with pleasure at
being home again and longing to get into the stall
by the side of Brunen. He had had quite enough
of the journey, and worked himself into a foam in
the harness to get over the Gilje hill.</p>

<p>Marit, the cook, and Torbj&#246;rg were out in the
porch before the kitchen; the three girls and J&#246;rgen
stood wholly absorbed by the load and the horse,
and the captain himself came down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Well, Great-Ola, how has Svarten pulled
through? Sweaty and tired, I see! Did you get my
uniform buttons? Ah, well! I hope you did not forget
the tobacco!&mdash;And my watch, could they do
anything with that?&mdash;Have you the bill?&mdash;Well,
then, you must put up Svarten&mdash;he shall have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
extra feed of oats to-day. What? What have you
got there?"</p>

<p>Besides the bill, Great-Ola had taken out of his
inside vest pocket a letter wrapped up in paper,
blue postal paper, with a beautiful red seal on it.
The captain looked at it a moment with surprise.
It was the writing of the governor's wife and her
seal in the wax, and without saying a word he
hastened in to his wife.</p>

<p>The load from the city, the great event of the
half year, occupied the attention of the whole
household. Its contents interested all, not the children
alone, and when Great-Ola, later in the evening,
sat in the kitchen, where he was treated as a
guest on account of his return home, and told about
his trip to the city and about Svarten and himself,
what miracles they had wrought on such and such
hills&mdash;and the load weighed this time at least two
hundred pounds more than the last&mdash;then there
was a sort of glamor about him and Svarten, too.</p>

<p>One evening he had even found his way in a
snowstorm, and once the salt-bag was forgotten,
and then Svarten actually would not stir from the
inn-yard, but lashed his tail at every cut of the
whip, and kept looking back, until the boy came
running out of the hall and shouted out about the
bag, then off he started willingly enough.</p>

<p>The captain had gone in and had wandered up
and down in the room for a while with the letter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the governor's wife in blue postal paper in his hand.
He looked very much offended at Ma, when she
seemed to think more about the load from the city
than about his letter. She only suggested gently that
they must talk about all that in the evening.</p>

<p>"All that&mdash;you say, Ma!&mdash;that Inger-Johanna
is invited down there next winter&mdash;and we have
R&#246;nnow to thank for it. That is short and clear
enough, I should think! What? What?" he roared
out impatiently. "Is it not plain?&mdash;or have you
some notions about it?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, dear J&#228;ger!"</p>

<p>"Well, then you should not delay the whole
unloading of the goods with your quiet sigh, full
of importance, and your secret meanings which always
make me mad. You know I hate it! I go
straight to the point always!"</p>

<p>"I was merely thinking about your uniform coat,
whether the tailor has sent the pieces with it, you
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are right, you are right, Gitta," and out he
rushed like a flash.</p>

<p>The unpacking went on in the kitchen, before
the spice closet with its numerous compartments,
where raisins, prunes, almonds, the different kinds
of sugar, allspice, and cinnamon, were each put into
their own places. Now and then fell a tribute, a
prune, two almonds, three raisins, to each of the
children; and it could not be denied that this load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
from the city was like a foretaste of Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>At first the captain was intensely interested in
getting hold of the ink bottles, the tobacco, and the
strong wares which were to be kept in the cellar&mdash;everything
else must be put aside for them. And
then he flew in and out, with one bill or another in
his hand and a quill pen full of ink, to compare
with the general bill which his wife had nailed up
on the upper door of the spice closet.</p>

<p>"Ma, can you conceive such extortion?" stopping
suddenly before the bill, which still finally was
always found to be right, and then turning thoughtfully
round again, while he dried his pen in his
chocolate-colored every-day wig.</p>

<p>His plethoric, vociferous, somewhat confused
nature always became furious when he saw a bill;
it operated like a red cloth on a bull, and when, as
now, all the half year's bills came storming down on
him at once, he both roared and bellowed. It was
an old story for his wife, who had acquired a remarkable
skill in taking the bull by the horns.</p>

<p>The wrongs, which thus he did <i>not</i> suffer, seemed
nevertheless to awaken an increasing storm of resentment
in him. With a violent tug at the door-latch,
and his wig awry, he would come suddenly
in, exclaiming,&mdash;"Seventy-five dollars, three shillings,
seventeen pence!&mdash;seventy-five&mdash;dollars&mdash;three
shillings&mdash;and seventeen pence!&mdash;it is almost
enough to make one crazy. And so you ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
citron&mdash;citron,"&mdash;he put on a falsetto tone, and
laughed out of pure rage. "He, he, he, he!&mdash;now
have we the means for that? And then, almond soap
for the guest-chamber!" This last came in a deep,
suppressed, gloomy bass. "I cannot understand
how you could have hit on that!"</p>

<p>"My dear, that was thrown in. Don't you see
that it isn't carried out for anything?"</p>

<p>"Thrown in&mdash;oh, thrown in&mdash;yes, there you
see how they cheat! Seventy-five dollars, three shillings,
and seventeen pence&mdash;plainly that is enough
to be frightened at. Where shall I find the money?"</p>

<p>"But you have already found it, J&#228;ger!&mdash;Remember
the servants," she whispered quickly. It
was a quiet prayer to put off the rest of the outburst
till later in the afternoon, between themselves.</p>

<p>The captain's various ecstatic flashes of passion
about the bills went over the house that afternoon
like a refreshing and purifying thunderstorm before
Christmas. The children, cowed and tortured,
took refuge during the storm under the protection
of their mother, who warded off the blast; but when
his step was again heard in the office, they went on,
just as persevering and inquisitive as before, peeping
into and shaking out the bags in order to find
a raisin or two or a currant that had been forgotten,
collecting the twine, looking after the weight,
and cutting up the bar soap.</p>

<p>During all these anxieties the tall form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
mistress stood in uninterrupted activity, bowed like
a crane over the box with the city wares, which had
been lifted in on the kitchen floor. Jars, willow baskets
filled with hay, small bags, and an infinity of
packages in gray wrappers, tied up with twine, small
and great, vanished by degrees into their different
resting-places, even to the last, the bag with the fine
wheat flour, which was brought in by Great-Ola
and put by itself in the meal-chest in the pantry.</p>

<p>When the spice closet was finally shut, the captain
stood there for the twentieth time. With the
air of a man who had been made to wait and been
tormented long enough, he gently tapped her on
the shoulder with his fingers and said, rather reproachfully,
"It really astonishes me, Gitta, that
you don't pay more attention to the letter we have
received to-day."</p>

<p>"I haven't been able to think of anything else
than your troubles with the bills, J&#228;ger. Now I
think you might taste the French brandy this evening,
to see if it is good enough for the Christmas
punch. Cognac is so dear."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, Gitta!&mdash;Yes, yes&mdash;only
let us have supper soon."</p>

<p>The plates with oatmeal porridge and the blue
milk in the cold cups were placed upon the table;
they stood like black, dreary islands over the cloth,
and presented no temptation to linger over the
evening meal.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>After the necessary part of it was swallowed and
the children were sent upstairs, the captain sat, now
quite cozy and comfortable, before the table, which
was still extended, with his tobacco and his taste of
toddy made of the French brandy, whose transformation
into Christmas punch was going on in
the kitchen, from which there was also heard the
sizzling of the waffle-iron.</p>

<p>"Only strong, Ma,&mdash;only strong!&mdash;Then you
can manage with the brown sugar.&mdash;Yes, yes," tasting
of the wooden dipper which his wife brought in,
"you can treat the sheriff to that with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Now Marit is coming in with the warm waffles,&mdash;and
then it was this about the letter of the governor's
wife.&mdash;You see, J&#228;ger, we cannot send the
child there unless we have her suitably fitted out;
she must have a black silk confirmation dress, city
boots and shoes, a hat, and other things."</p>

<p>"Black silk conf&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and some other dresses, which we must
order in Christiania; there is no help for it."</p>

<p>Captain J&#228;ger began to walk to and fro.</p>

<p>"So, so!&mdash;So, so! Well, if that is your idea, then
I think we will decline the invitation with thanks."</p>

<p>"I knew that, J&#228;ger! You would like to have the
yolk, but as to breaking the egg, you hesitate."</p>

<p>"Break the egg? Break my purse, you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean, you can call in a part of the six hundred
dollars you got with me. I have thought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
reckoned it over. Inger-Johanna alone will cost us
over one hundred dollars this year, and when
Thinka is going to Ryfylke, we shall not get off
with two hundred."</p>

<p>"Over two hundred dollars!&mdash;Are you crazy?
Are you crazy&mdash;really crazy, Ma? I think you
have a screw loose!" He made a sudden turn over
the floor. "The letter shall rather go at once into
the stove."</p>

<p>"Very well; you know that I think everything
you do is sensible, J&#228;ger."</p>

<p>He stopped, with the letter in his hand and his
mouth half open.</p>

<p>"And the slight chance Inger-Johanna might
have of being provided for, that perhaps is not so
much to be taken into account. She is certainly the
nearest relation. There is nothing in the way to prevent
her being the heir also.&mdash;N-no, do as you
will and as you like, J&#228;ger. You probably see more
clearly in this than I do.&mdash;And then you will take
the responsibility yourself, J&#228;ger,"&mdash;she sighed.</p>

<p>The captain crumpled the letter together, gave
her a hasty glance like a wounded lion, and then
stood awhile and stared at the floor. Suddenly he
threw the letter on the table and broke out: "She
must go!&mdash;But the cost of the campaign&mdash;the cost
of the campaign, Ma, that, I learned in my strategy,
must be borne by the enemy! And the governor's
wife must naturally take care of her outfit there."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>"The governor's wife, J&#228;ger, must not pay for
anything&mdash;not a bit&mdash;before she has decided if she
will keep her. We must not be anxious to be rid of
her; but <i>she</i> shall be anxious to get her; and she
must ask us for her, both once and twice, you
understand."</p>

<p class="p3t">That the winter was coming on was less noticed
this year than usual. Two children were to be fitted
out. Soon spinning-wheel and reel accompanied, in
the short day and long evening, the murmur of the
stove. Ma herself spun all the fine woof for the
linsey-woolsey dresses. There was knitting, weaving,
and sewing, nay, also embroidery on linen&mdash;"twelve
of everything for each one." And in school
hours in the office the captain worked not less zealously
with the French grammar.</p>

<p>The stiffening cold frost, which blew about the
house and cut like ice from every crack; the cold
so fierce that the skin was torn off the hands when
any one was unlucky enough to take hold of the
latch of the outer door or of the porch without mittens;
complaints of nail ache, when the children
came in from out-of-doors; or else that the drinking-water
was frozen solid in the tubs and pails, that the
meat must be thawed out,&mdash;this was only what was
usual in the mountain region. The doleful, monotonous
howling and the long, hungry yelling of the
wolves down on the ice could be heard from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Gilje hills both by day and by night. The road on
the lake lasted a long time. It was there till long into
the spring thaw, though worn, unsafe, and blue with
its dirt-brown mudstreak.</p>

<p>But when it did disappear, and the ice was melted
by the heat of the sun, there lay on the steep hill
behind the house a long line of bleaching linen, so
shining white that it seemed as if the snow had forgotten
to go away there.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter III</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was midsummer. The mountain region was
hazy in the heat; all the distance was as if enveloped
in smoke. The girls on the farm went about
barefooted, in waists and short petticoats. It was
a scorching heat, so that the pitch ran in sticky
white lines down from the fat knots in the timber
of the newly built pigsty, where Marit was giving
swill to the hogs. Some sand-scoured wooden milk-pans
stood on edge by the well, drying, while one
or two sparrows and wagtails hopped about or
perched nodding on the well-curb, and the blows of
the axe resounded from the wood-shed in the quiet
of the afternoon. Pasop lay panting in the shade
behind the outer door, which stood open.</p>

<p>The captain had finished his afternoon nap, and
stood by the field looking at Great-Ola and the
horses ploughing up an old grassland which was
to be laid down again.</p>

<p>The bumble-bee was humming in the garden.
With about the same monotonous voice, Thinka
and Inger-Johanna, sitting by the stone table in the
summer-house over the cracked blue book-cover
and the dog-eared, well-thumbed leaves, mumbled
the Catechism and Commentary, with elbows and
heads close to each other. They had to learn pages
eighty-four to eighty-seven before supper time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
they held their fingers in their ears so as not to disturb
each other.</p>

<p>There was darkness like a shadow just outside of
the garden fence. But they saw nothing, heard nothing;
the long passage of Scripture went way over on
the second page.</p>

<p>Then there was a gay clearing of a throat. "Might
one interrupt the two young ladies with earthly
affairs?"</p>

<p>They both looked up at the same time. The light
hop leaves about the summer-house had not yet
entirely covered the trellis.</p>

<p>With his arms leaning on the garden fence there
stood a young man&mdash;he might have been standing
there a long time&mdash;with a cap almost without a visor
over thick brown hair. His face was sunburned and
swollen.</p>

<p>The eyes, which gazed on them, looked dreadfully
wicked.</p>

<p>Neither of them saw more; for, by a common impulse
at the phenomenon, they ran in utter panic
out of the door, leaving the books spread open behind
them, and up the steps in to Ma, who was
in the kitchen buttering bread for lunch.</p>

<p>"There was a man standing&mdash;there was a man
out by the garden fence. It was certainly not any one
who goes around begging or anything like that."</p>

<p>"Hear what he has to say, J&#246;rgen," said Ma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
quickly comprehending the situation; "this way,
out the veranda door. Appear as if you came of your
own accord."</p>

<p>Both the girls flew in to the windows of the best
room in order to peep out under the curtains.</p>

<p>He was coming in by the steps to the outer door
with J&#246;rgen, who suddenly vanished from his sight
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Little Thea stood in the door of the sitting-room
with a piece of bread and butter, clutching the latch,
and, holding the door half shut and half open, stared
at him; she was altogether out of it.</p>

<p>"Is your father at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you must go by the kitchen path, do
you hear? And wait till we have had lunch; he is
not going up to the office before that." She took him
for a man who was going to be put on the roll.</p>

<p>"But I am not going to the office, you see."</p>

<p>Ma herself came now; she had managed to get
her cap on in her hurry, but it was all awry.</p>

<p>"A young man, I see, who has perhaps come a
long distance to-day. Please walk in."</p>

<p>Her smile was kind, but her eye underneath it
was as sharp as an officer's review; here were holes
and darns with coarse thread for the nonce and rents
in abundance, and it was not easy to free herself from
the suspicion of some questionable rover, especially
when he dropped straight in through the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
with the remark: "I come like a tramp from the
mountain wilds, madam. I must make many excuses."</p>

<p>Ma's searching look had in the mean time broken
through the shell. The white streak on the upper
part of the forehead, under the shade where the skin
had not been reddened by the sunburn, and his
whole manner determined her to scrutinize him
prudently. "Please sit down, J&#228;ger is coming soon."
She incidentally passed by the sewing-table and shut
it. "Won't you let me send you a glass of milk in
the mean time?"</p>

<p>A girl came in with a great basin, shaped like
a bowl, and vanished again.</p>

<p>He put it to his mouth, noted with his eye how
much he had drunk, drank again, and took another
view.</p>

<p>"It is delightful&mdash;is not at all like the mistress
of the house, for she seemed like sour milk, and"&mdash;he
suppressed a sigh&mdash;"dangerously dignified."</p>

<p>He drank again.</p>

<p>"Yes, now one really must stop; but since and
whereas&mdash;"</p>

<p>He placed the basin quite empty on the plate.</p>

<p>"Best to attack him at once. Dead broke, will you
on my honest face lend me four&mdash;no, that does not
sound well, better out with it at once&mdash;five dollars,
so that I can get to Christiania?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>The small eyes twinkled quickly. If only the
captain had come then! Some one was walking
about out there.</p>

<p>He gazed abstractedly; he repeated his speech
to himself. It was always altered, and now he stood
again at the ticklish point&mdash;the amount. He considered
if perhaps he only needed to ask for four&mdash;three?</p>

<p>There was a growling out in the hall; the dog
rushed out, barking loudly. It was plainly the
captain.</p>

<p>The young man rose hurriedly, but sat down
again like a spring ready to jump up out of a chair:
he had been in too great haste.</p>

<p>"In the parlor&mdash;some sort of fellow who wants
to talk with me?" It was out on the stairs that
some one was speaking.</p>

<p>A moment or two later, and the captain appeared
in the door.</p>

<p>"I must beg you to excuse me, Captain. I have
unfortunately, unfortunately"&mdash;here he began to
stammer; bad luck would have it that one of the
two young girls whom he had seen in the summer-house,
the dark one, came in after her father; and
so it would not do&mdash;"come over the mountain,"
he continued. "You will understand that one cannot
exactly appear in the best plight." The last
came in a tone of forced ease.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>The captain at that moment did not appear exactly
agreeably surprised.</p>

<p>"My name is Arent Grip!"</p>

<p>"Arent Grip!" rejoined the captain, looking at
him. "Grip! the same phiz and eyes! You can
never be the son of Perpetuum&mdash;cadet at Lurleiken?
He is a farmer, or proprietor I suppose he
calls himself, somewhere among the fjords."</p>

<p>"He is my father, Captain."</p>

<p>"Does he still work as hard as ever at his
mechanical ideas?" asked the captain. "I heard
that he had carried the water for his mill straight
through the roof of the cow-barn, so that the cows
got a shower bath, when the pipes sprung a leak."</p>

<p>Inger-Johanna caught a movement of indignation,
as if the stranger suddenly grasped after his
cap. "Shame, shame, that those times did not give
a man like my father a scientific education." He
said this with a seriousness utterly oblivious of
the captain.</p>

<p>"So, so. Well, my boy, you must be kind
enough to take a little lunch with us, before you
start off. Inger-Johanna, tell Ma that we want
something to drink and bread and butter. You
must be hungry coming down from the mountains.
Sit down.&mdash;And what is now your&mdash;your
occupation or profession in the world? if I might
ask." The captain sauntered around the floor.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"Student; and, Captain," he gasped, in order to
use quickly the moment while they were alone,
"since I have been so free as to come in here thus
without knowing you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Student!" The captain stopped in the middle
of the floor. "Yes, I would have risked my head
on it, saw it at the first glance, but yet I was a little
in doubt. Well, yes," clearing his throat, "nearly
plucked, perhaps; eh, boy?" inquired he good-naturedly.
"Your father also had trouble with his
examinations."</p>

<p>"I have not the fractional part of my father's
brains, but with what I have, they gave me this year
<i>laudabilis praeceteris</i>."</p>

<p>"Son of my friend, Fin Arentzen Grip!" He
uttered each one of the names with a certain tender
recognition. "Your father was, all things considered,
a man of good ability, not to say a little of
a genius,&mdash;when he failed in his officer's examination,
it was all due to his irregular notions. Well,
so you are his son! Yes, he wrote many a composition
for me&mdash;the pinch was always with the
compositions, you see."</p>

<p>"And, Captain," began the young man again
earnestly, now in a louder and more decided tone,
"since I can thus, without further ceremony, confidently
address you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can tell Ma," said the captain, when Inger-Johanna
again came in with her taller, overgrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
sister, "that it is Student Arent Grip, son of
my old delightful comrade at the Military School."</p>

<p>The result of this last message was that the contemplated
plate with a glass and bread and butter
was changed to a little lunch for him and the captain,
spread out on a tray.</p>

<p>The old bread-basket of red lacquer was filled
with slices of black, sour bread, the crusts of which
were cracked off. More's the pity, Ma declared,
it had been spoiled in the baking, and the gray,
heavy crust was due to the fact that so much of the
grain on the captain's farm last year was harvested
before it was ripe.</p>

<p>The student showed the sincerity of his forbearance
of these defects through an absolutely murderous
appetite. The prudential lumps of salt, which
studded the fresh mountain butter with pearly
tears in a superfluous abundance, he had a knack
of dodging boldly and incisively, which did not
escape admiring eyes; only a single short stroke
of his knife on the under side of the bread and
butter, and the lumps of salt rained and pattered
over the plate.</p>

<p>"You will surely have some dried beef? I guess
you have not had much to eat to-day. Go and get
some more, Thinka. A little dram with the cheese,
what? You can believe that we tested many a good
old cheese in the den at your father's, and when
we had a spree, we sent for it, and it circulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
round from one party to another; and then the
apples from Bergen which he got by the bushel
by freighting-vessel from home! He was such a
greenhorn, and so kind hearted&mdash;too confiding for
such rascals as we! Oh, how we hunted through
his closet and boxes!&mdash;and then we did our exercises
at the same time; it was only his that the
teacher corrected through the whole class." The
captain emptied the second part of his long dram.
"Ah!" He held his glass up against the light, and
looked through it, as he was accustomed to. "But
nevertheless, there was something odd about him,
you know; you must see that such a one, straight
from the country, does not fit in at once. Never
forget when he first lectured us about perpetual
motion. It was done with only five apples in a
wheel, he said, and the apples must be absolutely
mathematically exact. It was that which got out and
ruined him, so people came to&mdash;yes, you know&mdash;comment
on it, and make fun of him; and that
hung on till the examination."</p>

<p>The student wriggled about.</p>

<p>The young ladies, who were sitting with their
sewing by the window, also noticed how he had now
forgotten himself; during the whole time he had
kept one boot under the chair behind the other in
order to conceal the sole of his shoes gaping wide
open. They were in good spirits, and hardly dared
to look at each other&mdash;son of a man who was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Perpetuum, was a cadet, and gave the cows a bath.
Father was dreadfully amusing when there were
strangers present.</p>

<p>"Not a moment's doubt that there were ideas&mdash;but
there was something obstinate about him.
To come, as he did, straight from the farm, and
then to begin to dispute with the teacher about
what is in the book, never succeeds well, especially
in physics in the Military School. And you can
believe that was a comedy."</p>

<p>"Then I will bet my head that it was not my
father who was wrong, Captain."</p>

<p>"Hm, hm&mdash;naturally yes, his father to a dot,"
he mumbled&mdash;"Hm, well, you have got <i>praeceteris</i>
all the same,&mdash;will you have a drop more?" came
the hospitable diversion.</p>

<p>"No, I thank you. But I will tell you how it was
with my father. It was just as it was with a hound
they had once at the judge's. There was such blood
and spirit in him that you would search long to find
his equal; but one day he bit a sheep, and so he had
to be cured. It was done by locking him up in a
sheepfold. There he stood, alone before the ram and
all the sheepfold. It seemed to him splendid fun.
Then the ram came leaping at him, and the dog
rolled heels over head. Pshaw, that was nothing;
but after the ram came tripping&mdash;before he could
rise&mdash;all the fifty sheep trip&mdash;trip&mdash;trip, over
him; then he was entirely confused. Again they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
stood opposite each other, and once more the ram
rushed in on the dog, and trip&mdash;trip&mdash;trip&mdash;trip,
came the feet of the whole flock of sheep over him.
So they kept on for fully two hours, until the dog
lay perfectly quiet and completely stunned. He
was cured, never bit a sheep again. But what he was
good for afterwards we had better not talk about&mdash;he
had been through the Military School, Captain."</p>

<p>When he looked up, he met the dark, intense
eyes of the mistress fixed on him; her capped head
immediately bent down over the sewing again.</p>

<p>The captain had listened more and more eagerly.
The cure of the hound interested him. It was only
at the last expression he discovered that there was
any hidden meaning in it.</p>

<p>"Hm&mdash;my dear Grip. Ah! Yes, you think that.
Hm, can't agree with you. There were skilful teachers,
and&mdash;ho, ho,&mdash;really we were not sheep&mdash;rather
wolves to meet with, my boy. But the cure,
I must admit, was disgraceful for a good dog, and
in so far&mdash;well, a drop more?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Captain."</p>

<p>"But what kind of a road do you say you have
been over, my boy?"</p>

<p>With the food and the glass and a half of cordial
which he had enjoyed, new life had come into the
young man. He looked at his clothes, and was even
so bold as to put his boots out; a great seam went
across one knee.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"I certainly might be set up as a scarecrow for
a terror and warning to all those who will depart
from the highway. It was all because at the post station
I met a deer-hunter, an excellent fellow. The
chap talked to me so long of what there was on the
mountain that I wanted to go with him."</p>

<p>"Extremely reasonable," muttered the captain,
"when a man is paying for his son in Christiania."</p>

<p>"I had become curious, I must tell you, and so
started off for the heart of the mountains."</p>

<p>"Is he not even more aggravatingly mad than his
father,&mdash;to start in haphazard over the black, pathless
mountain?"</p>

<p>"The track led over the d&#233;bris and stones at
the foot at first for five hours. But I don't know
what it is upon the mountain; it was as if something
got into my legs. The air was so fine and
light, as if I had been drinking champagne; it intoxicated
me. I should have liked to walk on my
hands, and it would have been of no consequence
to any one in the whole wide world, for I was on
the summit. And never in my life have I seen such
a view as when we stood, in the afternoon, on the
mountain crest,&mdash;only cool, white, shining snow,
and dark blue sky, peak on peak, one behind the
other, in a glory as far as the eye could reach."</p>

<p>"Yes, we have snow enough, my boy. It stands
close up against the walls of the house here all winter,
as clear, white, and cold as any one could wish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
We find ourselves very well satisfied with that,&mdash;but
show me a beautiful green meadow or a fine
field of grain, my boy."</p>

<p>"It seemed to me as if one great fellow of a
mountain stood by the side of another and said:
You poor, thin-legged, puny being, are you not
going to be blown away in the blue draught, here on
the snow-field, like a scrap of paper? If you wish
to know what is great, take your standard from us."</p>

<p>"You got <i>praeceteris</i>, you said, my man? Yes,
yes, yes, yes! What do you say if we get the shoemaker
to put a little patch on your shoes to-night?"</p>

<p>It was as much as an invitation to stay all night!&mdash;Extremely
tempting to postpone the request till
next day. "Thank you, Captain, I will not deny that
it might be decidedly practical."</p>

<p>"Tell the shoemaker, J&#246;rgen, to take them as
soon as he has put the heel-irons on those I am to
have for the survey of the roads."</p>

<p>Oh! So he is going away, perhaps early to-morrow
morning; it must be done this evening, nevertheless!
Now, when the daughters were beginning
to clear off the table, it was best to watch his
chance.</p>

<p>The captain began walking up and down the
floor with short steps. "Yes, yes, true! Yes, yes,
true! Would you like to see some fine pigs,
Grip?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>The student immediately sprang up. The way
out! He grabbed his cap. "Do you keep many,
Captain?" he asked, extremely interested.</p>

<p>"Come!&mdash;oh, it is no matter about going
through the kitchen&mdash;come out a little while on
the porch steps. Do you see that light spot in the
woods up there? That is where we took the timber
for the cow-house and the pigsty, two years
ago."</p>

<p>He went out into the farmyard bare-headed.</p>

<p>"Marit, Marit, here is some one who wants to
see your pigs. Now you shall be reviewed. There are
a sow and seven&mdash;you see. Ugh, ugh, yes. Hear
your little ones, Marit!&mdash;But it was the brick wall,
you see. Right here was a swamp hole; it oozed
through from the brook above. And now&mdash;see the
drain there?&mdash;as dry as tinder."</p>

<p>Now or never the petition must be presented.</p>

<p>"And now they live like lords all together there,"
continued the captain.</p>

<p>"All seven of the dollars&mdash;what am I saying, all
five of the pigs."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Here is your hat, father!"&mdash;J&#246;rgen came from
the house&mdash;"and there are some of the people
down from Fosse standing there and waiting."</p>

<p>"So? We will only just look into the stable a
little."</p>

<p>There stood Svarten and Brunen, just unharnessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
still dripping wet and with stiff hair after
the work at the plough.</p>

<p>"Fine stall, eh?&mdash;and very light; the horses don't
come out of the door half blind. Ho, Svarten, are
you sweaty now?"</p>

<p>There was a warm and pleasant smell of the stable&mdash;and
finally&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain, I am going to make a re&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Ola," interrupted the latter, "see Brunen's
crib there! I don't like those bits. It can't be that
he bites it?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha&mdash;no, by no means." Ola grinned
slyly; he was not going to admit in a stranger's presence
that the captain's new bay was a cribber!</p>

<p>The captain had become very red; he pulled off
his cap, and hurriedly walked along with it in his
hand&mdash;"such a rascal of a horse-trader!"</p>

<p>He no longer looked as if he would listen to a
request.</p>

<p>Out of the afternoon shade by the stable walls the
two men just spoken of appeared.</p>

<p>"Is this a time of day to come to people?" he
blurted out. "Ah well&mdash;go up to the office."</p>

<p>At this he strode over the yard, peeped into the
well, and turned towards the window of the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Girls! Inger-Johanna&mdash;Thinka," he called in
a loud tone. "Ask Ma if that piece of meat is going
to lie there by the well and rot."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"Marit has taken it up, we are going to have it
for supper," Thinka tried to whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh! Is it necessary on that account to keep it
where Pasop can get it?&mdash;Show the student down
into the garden, so that he can get some currants,"
he called out of the door, as he went up by the
stables to his office.</p>

<p>Arent Grip's head, covered with thick brown hair,
with the scanty flat cap upon it, could now be seen
for a good long time among the currant bushes by
the side of Thinka's little tall, blond one. At first
he talked a great deal, and the sprightly, bright,
brown eyes were not in the least wicked, Thinka
thought. She began to feel rather a warm interest in
him.</p>

<p class="p3t">He found his boots in the morning standing
mended before his bed, and a tray with coffee and
breakfast came up to him. He had said he must be
off early.</p>

<p>Now it all depended on making his decisive leap
with closed eyes in the dark.</p>

<p>When he came down, the captain stood on the
stairs with his pipe. Over his fat neck, where the
buckle of his military stock shone, grayish locks of
hair stuck out under his reddish wig. He was looking
out a little discontentedly into the morning fog,
speculating on whether it would settle or rise so that
he would dare order the mowing to go on.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>"So you are going to start, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Captain, can&mdash;will you lend me&mdash;" in his first
courage of the morning he had thought of five, but
it sank to four even while he was on the stairs, and
now in the presence of the captain to&mdash;"three dollars?
I have used up every shilling I had to get to
Christiania with. You shall have them by money
order immediately."</p>

<p>The captain hemmed and hawed. He had almost
suspected something of the sort yesterday in the fellow's
face&mdash;yes, such a student was the kind of a
fellow to send back a money order!</p>

<p>There began to be a sort of an ugly grin on his
face. But suddenly he assumed a good-natured, free
and easy mien. "Three dollars, you say?&mdash;If I had
three in the house, my boy! But here, by fits and
starts in the summer, it is as if the ready money was
clean swept away." He stuck his unoccupied hand
in the breast of his uniform coat, and looked vacantly
out into the air. "Ah! hm-hm," came after a dreadfully
oppressive pause. "If I was only sure of getting
them back again, I would see if I could pick up
three or four shillings at any rate in Ma's household
box&mdash;so that you could get down to the sheriff or
the judge. They are excellent people, I know them;
they help at the first word."</p>

<p>The captain, puffing vigorously at his pipe, went
into the kitchen to Ma, who was standing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
pantry and dealing out the breakfast. She had the
hay-making and the whole of the outside affairs
upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>He was away quite a little time.</p>

<p>"Well, if Ma did not have the three dollars after
all! So I have got them for you. And so good-by
from Gilje! Let us hear when you get there."</p>

<p>"You shall hear in a money order," and the student
strode jubilantly away.</p>

<p>It is true that at first Ma had stopped for a moment
and pinched her lips together, and then she
had declared as her most settled opinion that, if the
captain was going to help at all, it must be with all
three. He did not seem one of those who shirked
everything&mdash;was not one who was all surface&mdash;and
it would not do at all to let him beg at the judge's, the
sheriff's, and perhaps the minister's, because he
could not get a loan of more than three shillings at
Gilje.</p>

<p class="p3t">From time to time Thinka told of all that she and
the student had talked about together.</p>

<p>"What did he say then?" urged Inger-Johanna.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was entertaining almost all the time; I
have never heard any one so entertaining."</p>

<p>"Yes, but do you remember that he said anything?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he asked why you were reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
French. Perhaps you were to be trained to be a parrot,
so that you could chatter when you came to the
city.</p>

<p>"So,&mdash;how did he know that I was going to the
city?"</p>

<p>"He asked how old you were; and then I said
that you were to be confirmed and to go there.
He was very well acquainted at the governor's
house; he had done extra writing, or something of
that sort, at the office, since he had been a student."</p>

<p>"That kind of acquaintance, yes."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't suit exactly there, he said;
and do you know why?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you want to know? He thought you had
too much backbone."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;did he say?"</p>

<p>She wrinkled her eyebrows and looked up
sharply, so that Thinka hastened to add: "Whoever
comes there must be able to wind like a sewing
thread around the governor's wife, he said; it
would be a shame for your beautiful neck to get
a twist so early."</p>

<p>Inger-Johanna threw her head back and smiled:
"Did you ever hear such a man!"</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Thinka had gone to Ryfylke. Her place at the
table, in the living-room, in the bed-chamber, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
empty air. The captain started out time after time
to call her.</p>

<p>And now the last afternoon had come, when
Inger-Johanna was also going away.</p>

<p>The sealskin trunk with new iron bands stood
open in the hall ready for packing. The cariole
was standing in the shed, greased so that the oil
was running out of the ends of the axles, and Great-Ola,
who was to start the next morning on the three
days' journey, was giving Svarten oats.</p>

<p>The captain had been terribly busy that day:
no one understood how to pack as he did.</p>

<p>Ma handed over to him one piece of the new
precious stuff after the other; the linen from Gilje
would bear the eye of the governor's wife.</p>

<p>But the misfortune of it was that the blood
rushed so to J&#228;ger's head when he stooped over.</p>

<p>"Hullo, good! I don't understand what you
are thinking of, Ma, to come with all that load of
cotton stockings at once! It is this, this, this I
want."</p>

<p>Naturally, used to travelling as he was&mdash;"But it
is so bad for you to stoop over, J&#228;ger."</p>

<p>He straightened up hurriedly. "Do you think
Great-Ola has the wit to rub Svarten with Riga
liniment on the bruise on his neck and to take the
bottle with him in his bag? If I had not thought
of that now, Svarten would have had to trot with
it. Run down and tell him that, Thea.&mdash;Oh, no!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
he drew a despairing breath; "I must go myself,
and see that it is done right."</p>

<p>There was a pause until his footfall had ceased
to creak on the lowest step. Then Ma began to
pack with precipitous haste: "It is best to spare
your father from the rush of blood to his head."</p>

<p>The contents of the trunk rose layer upon layer,
until the white napkin was at last spread over it
and covered the whole, and it only remained to sit
upon the lid and force the key to turn in the lock.</p>

<p>Towards supper time the worst hubbub and
trouble were over. Ma's hasty-pudding, as smooth
as velvet, with raspberry sauce, was standing on the
table, and solemnly reminded them that again there
would be one less in the daily circle.</p>

<p>They ate in silence without any other sound
than the rattling of the spoons.</p>

<p>"There, child, take my large cup. Take it when
your father bids you."</p>

<p>Certainly she is beautiful, the apple of his eye.
Only look at her hands when she is eating! She
is as delicate and pale as a nun.</p>

<p>He sighed, greatly down-hearted, and shoved
his plate from him.</p>

<p>Tears burst from Inger-Johanna's eyes.</p>

<p>No one would have any more.</p>

<p>Now he walked and whistled and gazed on the
floor.</p>

<p>It was a pity to see how unhappy father was.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>"You must write every month, child&mdash;at length
and about everything&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;large and
small, whatever you are thinking of, so that your
father may have something to take pleasure in,"
Ma admonished, while they were clearing off the
table. "And listen now, Inger-Johanna," she continued
when they were alone in the pantry: "If it
is so that the governor's wife wants to read your
letters, then put a little cross by the signature.
But if there is anything the matter, tell it to old
Aunt Alette out in the bishop's mansion; then I
shall know it when Great-Ola is in for the city
load. You know your father can bear so little that
is disagreeable."</p>

<p>"The governor's wife read what I write to you
and father! That I will defy her to do."</p>

<p>"You must accommodate yourself to her wishes,
child. You can do it easily when you try, and your
aunt is extremely kind and good to those she likes,
when she has things her own way. You know how
much may depend on her liking you, and&mdash;you
understand&mdash;getting a little fond of you. She has
certainly not asked you there without thinking of
keeping you in the place of a daughter."</p>

<p>"Any one else's daughter? Take me from you
and father? No, in that case I would rather never
go there."</p>

<p>She seated herself on the edge of the meal-chest
and began to sob violently.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come, Inger-Johanna." Ma stroked her
hair with her hand. "We do not wish to lose you;
you know that well enough,"&mdash;her voice trembled.
"It is for your own advantage, child. What do you
think you three girls have to depend upon, if your
father should be taken away? We must be glad if
a place offers, and even take good care not to lose
it; remember that, always remember that, Inger-Johanna.
You have intelligence enough, if you can
also learn to control your will; that is your danger,
child."</p>

<p>Inger-Johanna looked up at her mother with
an expression almost of terror. She had a bitter
struggle to understand. In her, in whom she had
always found aid, there was suddenly a glimpse of
the helpless.</p>

<p>"I can hardly bear to lose the young one out
of my sight to-night, and you leave me alone in
there," came the captain, creaking in the door.
"You haven't a thought of how desolate and lonesome
it will be for me, Ma." He blew out like a
whale.</p>

<p>"We are all coming in now, and perhaps father
will sing a little this evening," Ma said encouragingly.</p>

<p>The captain's fine, now a little hoarse, bass was
his pride and renown from his youth up.</p>

<p>The clavichord was cleared of its books and papers&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
cover must be entirely lifted when father was
to sing.</p>

<p>It stood there with its yellow teeth, its thin, high
tone, and its four dead keys; and Ma must play
the accompaniment, in which always, in some part
or other, she was left lying behind, like a sack that
has fallen out of a wagon, while the horse patiently
trots on over the road. His impatience she bore
with stoical tranquillity.</p>

<p>This evening he went through <i>Heimkringlas
panna</i>, <i>du h&#246;ga Nord</i>, and <i>Vikingebalken</i>, to</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">

<h2><i>Chapter IV</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> year had turned. It was as long after
Christmas as the middle of February.</p>

<p>In the evening the captain was sitting, with two
candles in tin candlesticks, smoking and reading
<i>Hermoder</i>. At the other end of the table the light
was used by J&#246;rgen, who was studying his lessons;
he must worry out the hours that had been assigned,
whether he knew the lessons or not.</p>

<p>The frosty panes shone almost as white as marble
in the moonlight, which printed the whole of a pale
window on the door panel in the lower, unlighted
end of the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Certainly there were bells!</p>

<p>J&#246;rgen raised his head, covered with coarse, yellow
hair, from his book. It was the second time he
had heard them, far away on the hill; but, like the
sentinels of Haakon Adelstensfostre at the beacon,
of whom he was just reading, he did not dare to
jump up from his reading and give the alarm until
he was sure.</p>

<p>"I think there are bells on the road," he gently
remarked, "far off."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! attend to your lesson."</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding he pretended that he was
deeply absorbed in the esthetic depths of <i>Hermoder</i>,
the captain also sat with open ears.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"The trader's bells&mdash;they are so dull and low,"
J&#246;rgen put in again.</p>

<p>"If you disturb me again, J&#246;rgen, you shall hear
the bells about your own ears."</p>

<p>The trader, &#214;jseth, was the last one the captain
could think of wishing to see at the farm. He kept
writing and writing after those paltry thirty dollars
of his, as if he believed he would lose them. "Hm!
hm!" He grew somewhat red in the face, and read
on, determined not to see the man before he was
standing in the room.</p>

<p>The bells plainly stopped before the door.</p>

<p>"Hm! hm!"</p>

<p>J&#246;rgen moved uneasily.</p>

<p>"If you move off the spot, boy, I'll break your
arms and legs in pieces!" foamed the captain, now
red as copper. "Sit&mdash;sit still and read!"</p>

<p>He intended also to sit still himself. That scoundrel
of a trader&mdash;he should fasten his horse himself
at the doorsteps, and help himself as he could.</p>

<p>"I hear them talking&mdash;Great-Ola."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" said the captain in a murderous
deep bass, and with a pair of eyes fixed on
his son as if he could eat him.</p>

<p>"Yes; but, father, it is really&mdash;"</p>

<p>A pull on his forelock and a box on the ears
sent him across the floor.</p>

<p>"The doctor," roared J&#246;rgen.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>The truth of his martyrdom was established in
the same moment, because the short, square form
of the military doctor appeared in the door.</p>

<p>His fur coat was all unbuttoned, and the tip of
his long scarf trailed behind him on the threshold.
He held his watch out: "What time is it?"</p>

<p>"Now, then, may the devil take your body and
soul to hell, where you long ago belonged, if it isn't
you, Rist!"</p>

<p>"What time is it? I say&mdash;Look!"</p>

<p>"And here I go and lick J&#246;rgen for&mdash;well, well,
boy, you shall be excused from your lesson and can
ask for syrup on your porridge this evening. Go
out to Ma, and tell her Rist is here."</p>

<p>The captain opened the kitchen door: "Hullo,
Marit! Siri! A girl in here to pull off the doctor's
boots! All the diseases of the country are in your
clothes."</p>

<p>"What time is it, I say&mdash;can you see?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five minutes of seven."</p>

<p>"Twenty-one miles in two hours and a quarter&mdash;from
J&#246;lstad here, with my bay!"</p>

<p>The doctor had got his fur coat off. The short,
muscular man, with broad face and reddish-gray
whiskers, stood there in a fur cap, swallowed up in
a pair of long travelling boots.</p>

<p>"No, no," he exclaimed to the girl, who was making
an effort to pull them off. "Oh, listen, J&#228;ger;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
will you go out and feel of the bay's hind leg, if there
is a wind-gall? He began to stumble a little, just
here on the hill, I thought, and to limp."</p>

<p>"He has very likely got bruised." The captain
eagerly grabbed his hat from the clavichord and
went with him.</p>

<p>Outside by the sleigh they stood, thinly clothed
in the severe frost, and felt over the hamstring and
lifted up the left hind foot of the bay. For a final
examination, they went into the stable.</p>

<p>When they came out there was a veritable wild
dispute.</p>

<p>"I tell you, you might just as well have said he
had glanders in his hind legs. If you are not a better
judge of curing men than you are of horses, I
wouldn't give four shillings for your whole medical
examination."</p>

<p>"That brown horse of yours, J&#228;ger&mdash;that is a
strange fodder he takes. Doesn't he content himself
with crib-splinters?" retorted the doctor, slyly
bantering.</p>

<p>"What? Did you see that, you&mdash;knacker?"</p>

<p>"Heard it, heard it; he gnawed like a saw there
in the crib. He has cheated you unmercifully&mdash;that
man from Filtvedt, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, in a year he will be tall enough for a cavalry
horse. But this I shall concede, it was a good
trade when you got the bay for sixty-five."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>"Sixty and a binding dram, not a doit more. But
I would not sell him, if you offered me a hundred
on the spot."</p>

<p>Ma was waiting in her parlor.</p>

<p>Now, it was Aslak of Vaelta who had cut his foot
last Thursday hewing timber&mdash;Ma had bandaged
him&mdash;and then Anders, who lived in the cottage,
was in a lung fever. The parish clerk had been
there and bled him; six children up in that hut&mdash;not
good if he should be taken away.</p>

<p>"We will put a good Spanish-fly blister on his
back, and, if that does not make him better, then
a good bleeding in addition."</p>

<p>"He came near fainting the last time," suggested
Ma, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Bleed&mdash;bleed&mdash;it is the blood which must be
got away from the chest, or the inflammation will
make an end of him. I will go and see him to-morrow
morning&mdash;and for Thea's throat, camphor oil
and a piece of woollen cloth, and to bed to sweat&mdash;and
a good spoonful of castor-oil to-night&mdash;you
can also rub the old beggar woman about the body
with camphor, if she complains too much. I will give
you some more."</p>

<p>After supper the old friend of the house sat with
his pipe and his glass of punch at one end of the
sofa, and the captain at the other. The red tint of
the doctor's nose and cheeks was not exclusively to
be attributed to the passage from the cold to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
snug warmth of the room. He had the reputation of
rather frequently consoling his bachelorhood with
ardent spirits.</p>

<p>They had talked themselves tired about horses
and last year's reminiscences of the camp, and had
now come to more domestic affairs.</p>

<p>"The news, you see, is blown here both from the
city and the West; old Aunt Alette wrote before
Christmas that the governor's wife had found out
she must drive with both snaffle and curb."</p>

<p>"I thought so," said the doctor, chewing his
mouthpiece. "The first thing of importance in
managing is to study the nature of the beast; and
Inger-Johanna's is to rear; she must be treated
gently."</p>

<p>"And that sister-in-law never believed that so
much inborn stuff could grow up in the wild mountain
region."</p>

<p>The captain began to puff impatiently. Ma would
surely sometime get supper ready and come in, so
he could get to his daughter's letters.</p>

<p>"You can believe he is a real pelican, that old
judge down in Ryfylke! Orders them round and
bellows&mdash;keeps them hot both in the office and in
the house. I wonder if he won't sometime apply for
an office somewhere else; for that is what he threatens
to do every time he sees an office vacant, Thinka
writes. Let us have the letters, Ma, and my spectacles,"
he exclaimed, when she came in. "The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
is of November, so you shall hear about your goddaughter's
coming to the governor's, Rist."</p>

<p>He hummed over a part of the beginning and
then read:</p>

<p class="p3t">When Great-Ola put my baggage inside the street
door, I almost wanted to seat myself in the cariole
and drive the three days home again; but then at
once I thought, best to march straight on, as father
says! I went past the servant and inside the hall
door. It was very light there, and a great many outside
garments and hats and caps were hanging on
the pegs, and twice two servant-girls flew through
with trays and teacups, without troubling themselves
about me in the least. But I thought that the
one who had fallen into the midst of things was your
beloved daughter. My outside garments were off in
a jiffy; I knocked once, twice, three times. I hardly
knew what to do with myself, so I gently turned
the knob. Thank heaven, there was no one there.
There was another door with a porti&#232;re, which I
only needed to shove a little aside, and then&mdash;I was
plunged right into the centre of it. Nay, how shall
I describe it? It was a corner room that I had entered:
there was only mahogany furniture and upholstered
easy chairs, and pictures in gilded frames
over the sofa; the other pictures were in dark
frames; but I did not see a doit of all that, for I
thought at first that it was dark. But it wasn't dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
at all. There was just a shade over the astral lamp
on the table, and neither more nor less than a whole
company. There in the lion's den, with the married
ladies on the corner sofa, sat a number of people
drinking tea.</p>

<p>I stood there in the middle of the floor, and the
reddish brown linsey-woolsey, I believed, could
surely defend itself.</p>

<p>"Aunt Zittow," I ventured.</p>

<p>"Who is it?&mdash;What? Can it be my dear Inger-Johanna?
My husband's niece!" was said from the
table. "You have come just like a wild mountain
rose, child, with the rain still on your face&mdash;and so
cold!" as she touched me. But I saw very well that
she had her eye on my dress. I am sure it is too long
in the waist, I thought; that is what I said at home.
But then I forgot the whole dress, for it was indeed
my aunt, and she embraced me and said, "You are
heartily welcome, my dear child! I think now a cup
of good hot tea will do her good, Miss J&#246;rgensen,&mdash;and
will you ask Mina to put her room in order upstairs!"
And then she seated me on a soft cushioned
chair by the side of the wall.</p>

<p>There I sat in the twilight, with a teacup in my
lap, and biscuits&mdash;how I got them I cannot remember&mdash;and
thought, is it I or not I?</p>

<p>At first it was not easy to see those who sat about
in the soft stuffed chairs; what I saw nearest to me
was a piece of a foot, with spurs and a broad red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
stripe along the side, which rocked up and down the
whole time. Now and then a head with a fine lace
cap bobbed up into the light to put down a cup or
to replenish it. The lamp-shade made just a round
ring in the room, not a foot from the table.</p>

<p>Oh, how warm and delicate it was!</p>

<p>In the light under the astral lamp-shade, aunt was
sitting, bowed down over a little black contrivance
with the image of a negro on it, and was burning
pastilles; her hair, on both sides of her forehead,
was made into stiff, grayish curls.</p>

<p>The bright, shining tea-kettle stood singing over
the beautiful blue cups of that old Copenhagen
porcelain, of which you have four pairs in the cabinet,
which came from grandmother's. I could not
help looking all the time on aunt's face, with the
great earrings showing through the lace. I thought
the antique tea-kettle, which is like a vase or urn,
resembled her so much, with the haughty stiff
curve of her chin! It was just as if they belonged
together from&mdash;I don't know from what time, it
could not be from the time of the creation, I suppose.
And then when the conversation among them
came to a stop and it was still as if there were not a
human being there, the machine puffed and snorted
as it were with aunt's fine Danish twist to the R:
<i>Arvet! Arvet!</i> (inherited)&mdash;and in between it bubbled
Zittow, von Zittow. It was what you told me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
mother, about the Danish Zittow, who was diplomatist
in Brussels, that was buzzing in me.</p>

<p class="p3t">"The young one! She has got it in her blood,"
whinnied the doctor.</p>

<p class="p3t">But it really did not look as if aunt thought there
was any hurry about seeing uncle. And then when
aunt sent Miss J&#246;rgensen with some tea into the
next room, where they were playing cards, I at once
asked if I could be allowed to go with her.</p>

<p>"With all my heart, my child, it would be a
shame to tax your patience any longer. And then,
Miss J&#246;rgensen, take our little traveller up to her
room, and see that she has something to eat, and
let her go to bed." But I saw very plainly that she
pulled the lamp-shade down on the side I was going;
that I thought of afterwards.</p>

<p>"What? what? what?" said my uncle. You
should have seen him gaze at me. He looked so
much like you, mother, about the forehead and
eyes that I threw my arms around his neck.</p>

<p>He held me before him with his arms stretched
out. "But really I think it is Aunt Eleonore all
over! Well, well, now don't fancy you are such a
beauty!"</p>

<p>That was the reception.</p>

<p>Shortly after I was lying in bed in my elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
little blue room, with curtains with long fringes.
There were pastilles on the stove, and Miss J&#246;rgensen&mdash;just
think, she called me Miss!&mdash;almost
undressed me and put me between all the soft down
quilts.</p>

<p>There I lay and thought it all over, and became
hotter and hotter in my head and face, till at last
it seemed as if I was thumping in the cariole with
Svarten and Ola.</p>

<p class="p3t">"No, the cariole came home again empty," said
the captain with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Look out if you don't get her back to Gilje
again in a carriage," added the doctor.</p>

<p>"She was so handsome, Rist," exclaimed the
captain, quite moved. "It seems as if I see her,
standing there in the middle of the floor at brother-in-law's,
with her heavy black hair dressed upon her
neck. From the time when she used to run about
here, with the three long braids down her back, it was
as if she developed into a swan all at once, when she
came to dress in the clothes of a full-grown person&mdash;You
remember her on confirmation day, Rist?"</p>

<p>"But, dear J&#228;ger," said Ma, trying to subdue
him.</p>

<p>The captain cautiously unfolded a letter, closely
written on a large sheet of letter paper.</p>

<p>"And now you shall hear; this is dated January
23d."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p class="p3t">The money which I brought with me&mdash;</p>

<p class="p3t">"Well, well&mdash;"</p>

<p class="p3t">The bill of Larsen for&mdash;</p>

<p class="p3t">"You can certainly skip over to the next page,"
remarked Ma with a certain emphasis.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, hm, hm,&mdash;mere trifles&mdash;here it is."</p>

<p class="p3t">To think that father, and you also, mother, cannot
see my two new dresses! Aunt is inconceivably
good. It is impossible to walk any other way than
beautifully in this kind of shoes; and that aunt
says I do; it is just as if you always felt a dancing-floor
under your feet. And yesterday aunt gave
me a pair of patent leather sandals with buckles
on the ankles. Did you ever hear of such! Yes&mdash;I
kissed her for that, too, this time; she could say
what she liked. For you must know, she says that
the first rule of life for a lady is a kind of confident,
reserved repose, which, however, may be
cordial! I have it naturally, aunt says, and only
need to cultivate it. I am going to learn to play
on the piano and go through a regular course of
lessons in dancing.</p>

<p>Aunt is so extremely good to me, only she will
have the windows shut when I want them open.
Of course I don't mean in the sitting-room, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
they have pasted themselves in with double panes,
but up in my own room. Just fancy, first double
windows and then stuffy curtains, and then all the
houses, which are near us across the street; you
can't breathe, and much use it is to air out the
rooms by the two upper panes twice a day!</p>

<p>Aunt says that I shall gradually get accustomed
to the city air. But I don't see how I can, when I
never get acquainted with it. Not once during the
whole winter have I frozen my fingers! We go out
for a short drive in the forenoon, and then I go
with aunt in the shops in the afternoon, and that
is the whole of it. And you can believe it is quite
another thing to go out here than at home; when
I only jumped over a little pile of shovelled-up
snow, in order to get into the sleigh more quickly,
aunt said that every one could instantly see manners
from my state of nature, as she always says.
For all the movements I make, I might just as well
have chains on both legs, like the prisoners we see
some days in the fort.</p>

<p>And now aunt wants me not to go bare-footed
on the floor of my chamber. Nay, you should have
seen her horror when I told her how Thinka and
I, at the time of the breaking up of the ice last
year, waded across the mill stream in order to
avoid the roundabout way by the bridge! At last
I got her to laughing with me. But I certainly
believe that the pair of elegant slippers with swansdown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
on them, which stuck out of a package this
morning, are for me! You see now, it is into them,
nevertheless, that my sweet little will must be put.</p>

<p class="p3t">"She is on her guard lest they should want to put
a halter about her neck," mumbled the doctor.</p>

<p>Ma sighed deeply. "Such sweet small wills are
so apt to grow into big ones, and"&mdash;again a sigh&mdash;"women
don't get on in the world with that."</p>

<p>The doctor looked meditatively down into his
glass: "One of woman's graces is flexibility, they
say; but on the other hand, she is called 'proud
maiden' in the ballad. There is something like a
contradiction in that."</p>

<p>"Oh, the devil! Divide them into two platoons!
It is mostly the ugly who have to be pliable," said
the captain.</p>

<p>"Beauty does not last so very long, and so it is
best to think of the years when one has to be accommodating,"
remarked Ma, down in her knitting-work.</p>

<p>The captain continued reading the letter.</p>

<p class="p3t">The French is done in a twinkling. I am always
ready with that before breakfast, and aunt is so
contented with my pronunciation; but then the
piano comes from nine to eleven. Ugh! only exercises;
and then aunt receives calls. Guess who
came day before yesterday? No one else than Student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Grip. It was just as if I must have known
him ever so well, and liked him even better, so
glad was I at last to see any one who knew about
us at home. But just think, I am not entirely sure
that he did not try to dictate to aunt; and then he
had the boldness to look at me as if I should agree
with him. Aunt helped him to a place in uncle's
office, because she heard that he had passed such an
excellent examination and was so gifted, but had
almost nothing from home to study on.</p>

<p class="p3t">"I ventured my three dollars on him&mdash;But how
the fellow could manage to take such high honors
passes my comprehension," threw out the captain.</p>

<p>"But he repaid them all right, J&#228;ger, with postage
and everything."</p>

<p>The captain held the letter up to the light again.</p>

<p class="p3t">And then aunt thought he would be the better for
a little polish in his ways, and enjoined him to
come to her fortnightly receptions; she likes to have
young people about her; but he let aunt see that
he regarded that as a command and compulsion.
And now he came in fact to make a sort of excuse.
But how they talked!</p>

<p>"Well, then, we shall see you again at some of
our Thursday evenings?" said aunt.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship no doubt remembers the occasion
of my remaining away. It was my ill-bred objections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
to the seven unanimous teacups which gave
supreme judgment in your celebrated small tea-fights."</p>

<p>"See, see, see," aunt smiled. "I can't be wrong
when I say that you are really made for social life;
there is need just there for all one's best sides."</p>

<p>"All one's smoothest, your ladyship means."</p>

<p>"Well, well, no falling back, Mr. Grip, I beg
you."</p>

<p>"I did my best, your ladyship; for I really
thought all one's most mendacious."</p>

<p>"Now you are in the humor of contradiction
again; and there one gets entangled so easily, you
know."</p>

<p>"I only think that when one does not agree with
what is said, and keeps silent, one lies."</p>

<p>"Then people offer up to good form, without
which no social intercourse can exist."</p>

<p>"Yes, what do they offer up? Truth!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps more correctly a little of their vanity,
an opportunity of exhibiting some bright and shining
talent; that tempts young men greatly, I believe."</p>

<p>"Possible, not impossible at any rate," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Do you see?" But then aunt said, for she never
abandons her text: "A little good manners is not
out of place; and when I see a bright young student
stand talking with his hands in his pockets, or riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
backwards on a chair, then, whether the one
concerned takes my motherly candor ill or not, I
always try by a little hint to adjust the defects in
his education."</p>

<p>You should have seen him! Hands out of his
pockets, and at once he sat up before her, as straight
as a candle.</p>

<p>"If all were like your ladyship, I would recommend
making calls," said he, "for you are an honest
woman."</p>

<p>"Woman! We say, lady."</p>

<p>"I mean an honest governor's lady; besides, I
don't at all say a good-natured!" and then he shook
that great brown lock of hair down over his forehead.</p>

<p>I do not need to wish for any portrait of you,
for I lie thinking, in the evenings, that I am at
home. I see father so plainly, walking up and down
the room whistling, and then starting off up the
office stairs; and I pull your hair, J&#246;rgen! and poke
your head down into the geography, so that I get
you after me, and we run round, in one door and
out another, up and down in the house. Nay, I
long horribly at times. But I must not let aunt see
that; it would be ungrateful. She does not believe
that one can exist anywhere but in a city.</p>

<p>And then there are a lot of things which I have
been obliged to draw a black mark through, because
I don't at all understand them. Only think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
mother! Aunt says, that it may at most be allowable
to say that we have cows at home; but I must
not presume to say that any one of them has a calf!
I should like to know how they think we get new
cows, when we kill the old ones for Christmas?</p>

<p class="p3t">Here the captain interpolated some inarticulate
noises. But an expression of anxiety came over
Ma's face, and she said faintly:</p>

<p>"That is because, unfortunately, we have not
been able to keep the children sufficiently away from
the servants' room, and from everything they hear
there."</p>

<p>"You see, madam," declared the doctor, "in the
city people are so proper that a hen hardly dares to
lay eggs&mdash;It is only the products of the efforts of
the land that they are willing to recognize, I can
tell you."</p>

<p>"No," the captain put in, "it is not advisable for
a poor mare to be so indiscreet as to have a foal
there."</p>

<p>His wife coughed gently and made an errand to
her sewing-table.</p>

<p class="p3t">Ma had been gone upstairs for more than an hour,
and the clock was getting on towards twelve.</p>

<p>The captain and the doctor were now sitting
somewhat stupidly over the heeltaps in their mugs,
a little like the dying tallow candles, which stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
with neglected wicks, almost burned down into the
sockets and running down.</p>

<p>"Keep your bay, Rist. Depend on me&mdash;he has
got to get up early who takes me in on a horse&mdash;with
my experience, you see. All the cavalry horses
I have picked out in my time!"</p>

<p>The doctor sat looking down into his glass.</p>

<p>"You are thinking of the cribber," said the captain,
getting into a passion; "but that was the most
rascally villainy&mdash;pure cheating. He might have
been taken into court for that&mdash;But, as I tell you,
keep your bay."</p>

<p>"I have become a little tired of him, you see."</p>

<p>"See there, see there,&mdash;but that is your own fault
and not the bay's, my boy. You are always tired of
the beast you have. If you should count all the
horses you have swapped, it would be a rare stable."</p>

<p>"They spoiled him for driving when he was a
colt; he is one-sided, he is."</p>

<p>"That's all bosh. I should cure him of that in
a fortnight, with a little breaking to harness."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am tired of sitting and pulling and hauling
on one rein to keep him out of the side of the
ditch; if it were not for that, the beast should never
go out of my hand. No, had it been only that he
made a few splinters in the crib."</p>

<p>The captain assumed a thoughtful expression;
he leaned against the back of the sofa, and gave two
or three deep, strong pulls on his pipe.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>"But my Brunen is nothing at all to talk about&mdash;a
little gnawing only&mdash;with the one eye-tooth."</p>

<p>"Nay, my bay also gives way only on one side of
the road."</p>

<p>Again two or three sounding puffs. The captain
gave his wig a poke.</p>

<p>"If there is any one who could cure him of that,
it is certainly I."</p>

<p>Dense smoke poured out of his pipe.</p>

<p>Over in his corner of the sofa the doctor began
to clean his out.</p>

<p>"Besides, my Brunen is a remarkably kind animal&mdash;thunders
a little on the crib down in the stall&mdash;a
horse can hardly have less of a fault, and then
so thoroughly easy on the rein&mdash;knows if one only
touches it&mdash;so extremely sensitive in his mouth&mdash;a
regular beauty to drive on the country road."</p>

<p>"Ye-s, ye-s; have nothing against that&mdash;fine
animal!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Rist! All things considered, that
was a driving horse for you&mdash;stands so obediently,
if one just lays the rein over his back."</p>

<p>"Swap off the bay, do you mean?" pondered the
doctor, in a doubting tone,&mdash;"hadn't really thought
of that." He shook his head&mdash;"Only I can't understand
why he is so stiff on one rein."</p>

<p>"No, my boy; but I can understand it."</p>

<p>"If you are only not cheated in that, J&#228;ger&mdash;trade
is trade, you know."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>"I cheated? Ha, ha, ha!" The captain shook
with laughter and with quiet consciousness. "Done,
boy! We will swap."</p>

<p>"You are rather quick on the rein, J&#228;ger."</p>

<p>"Always my nature, you see&mdash;to get the thing
closed up at once, on the nail. And so we will take
a drink to close the bargain," shouted the captain
eagerly; he pulled his wig awry, and sprang up.</p>

<p>"Let us see if Ma has some cognac in the
closet."</p>

<p class="p3t">What sort of a trick was it the horse had?</p>

<p>The captain was wholly absorbed in breaking the
bay to harness. The horse turned his head to the
right, and kept over on the side of the road just as
far as he could for the rein. It was impossible to
find any reason for it.</p>

<p>This morning he had broken off one of the trace-pins
by driving against the gate-post. Was it possible
that he was afraid of a shadow? That was an
idea!&mdash;and the captain determined to try him in
the moonlight that evening.</p>

<p>When he came down to the stable after dinner,
he saw a wonderful sight.</p>

<p>Great-Ola had taken the bay out of his stall, and
was standing shaking his fist against the horse's
forehead.</p>

<p>"Well, I have tried him every way, Captain, but
he wouldn't wink, not even if I broke his skull with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the back of an axe&mdash;he doesn't move! And now
see how he jumps!" He raised his hand towards
the other side of the horse's head. "But in his left
eye he is as blind as a shut cellar door."</p>

<p>The captain stood awhile without saying a word;
the veins on his forehead swelled up blue, and his
face became as red as the collar on his uniform coat.</p>

<p>"Well, then." In a rage he gave Ola a box on
his ears. "Are you standing there threatening the
horse, you dog?"</p>

<p>When Ola was feeding the horse at night, the
captain went into the stall. He took the lantern
and let it shine on the bay. "No use to cure you
of going into the ditch&mdash;See there, Ola, take that
shilling, so that you at all events may profit by it."</p>

<p>Ola's broad face lighted up with cunning. "The
doctor must provide himself with planks, for the
one he got ate up three two-inch boards while we
had him."</p>

<p>"Look here, Ola," nodded the captain, "it is not
worth while to let him hear anything but that the
bay can see with both eyes here with us."</p>

<p class="p3t">When Great-Ola, in breaking-up time in spring,
was driving a load of wood home from the Gilje
ridge, he was obliged to turn out on a snow-drift
for Dr. Rist, who was coming in a sleigh from the
north.</p>

<p>"Driving with the bay, I see. Has the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
got him so that he's all right? Does he cling just as
hard to the side of the road?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. The captain was the man to
make that all right. He is no more one-sided now
than I am."</p>

<p>"As if I was going to believe that, you liar,"
mumbled the doctor, while he whipped his horse
and drove on.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter V</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> captain was in a dreadful humor; the
doors were banging the whole forenoon.</p>

<p>At dinner time there was a sultry breathing spell,
during which J&#246;rgen and Thea sat with their eyes
on their plates, extremely cautious not to give any
occasion for an explosion.</p>

<p>The fruit of J&#246;rgen's best exertions to keep
himself unnoticed was nevertheless, as usual, less
happy. During the soup he accidentally made a
loud noise in eating with his spoon which led to a
thundering "Don't slobber like a hog, boy."</p>

<p>After dinner the captain all at once felt the necessity
of completing certain computations on a
chart and surveying matter that had been left since
the autumn.</p>

<p>And now it was not advisable to come too near
the office! He had an almost Indian quickness of
hearing for the least noise, and was absolutely wild
when he was disturbed.</p>

<p>It became quiet, a dead calm over the whole
house. The spinning-wheel alone could be heard
humming in the sitting-room, and they went gently
through the doors below, in genuine terror when
in spite of all they creaked or some one happened
to let the trap-door into the cellar fall or make the
porch door rattle.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>How could that foolish Torbj&#246;rg hit upon scouring
the stairs now? When she hurriedly retreated
with her sand and pail, her open mouth and staring
eyes showed plainly that she did not comprehend
the peculiar inward connection between her
scouring and the captain who was sitting safely up
there in his office: it was enough that he would fall
at once like a tempest down from the upper story.</p>

<p>Now there was a call from up there.</p>

<p>He came out from the office with his drawing-pen
in his mouth:</p>

<p>What had become of the old blue portfolio of
drawings? It had been lying on the table in the hall
upstairs&mdash;</p>

<p>Ma must go up, and Thea and J&#246;rgen with her,
to be questioned.</p>

<p>There&mdash;there on the table&mdash;there! it had been
lying for five months! Was it the intention to make
him entirely miserable with all this putting in order
and cleaning?</p>

<p>"But dear, dear J&#228;ger, we shall find it, if you will
only have a little patience&mdash;if we only look for it."</p>

<p>And there was a search round about everywhere;
even in the garret, under old window-panes, and
among tables, reels, chests, and old trumpery they
ransacked. In his anxious zeal, J&#246;rgen stood on his
head, digging deep down into a barrel, when Ma at
length sagaciously turned the investigation into the
office again. "On top of the cabinet in the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
there is a large blue portfolio, but you have looked
there, of course."</p>

<p>"There? I&mdash;I should like to know who has presumed
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>He vanished into the office again.</p>

<p>Yes, there it lay.</p>

<p>He flung down his ruling-pen; he really was not
in a mood to work any longer! He sat looking
gloomily out before him with his elbows leaning
against his writing-desk. "It is your fault I say, Ma!&mdash;or
was it possibly I who had the smart idea of
sending her to Ryfylke?" He struck the desk. "It
is blood money&mdash;blood money, I say! If it is to
go on in this way, what shall we have to get J&#246;rgen
on with?&mdash;Huf, it goes to my head so&mdash;eighteen
dollars actually thrown into the brook."</p>

<p>"She must have a Sunday dress; Thinka has
now worn the clothes she brought from home over
a year and a half."</p>

<p>"Even new laced cloth shoes from Stavanger.
Yes, indeed, not less than from Stavanger&mdash;it is put
down so&mdash;" he snatched the bill from the desk&mdash;"and
a patent leather belt, and for half-soling and
mending shoes two dollars and a quarter&mdash;and
then sewing things! I never heard that a young girl
in a house bought sewing things&mdash;and postage a
dollar and a half&mdash;it is wholly incredible."</p>

<p>"For the year and a half, you must remember,
J&#228;ger, fifteen cents for each letter."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"A miserly judge, I say, who does not even pay
for the letters which go from the office! Now, why
did she write last when she had just before sent messages
in the letter from your sister-in-law? But there
it comes with a vengeance&mdash;four and a half yards
of silk ribbon! Why didn't she make it ten, twenty
yards&mdash;as long as from here to Ryfylke? Then she
might have broken her father at once; for I see what
it leads to."</p>

<p>"Remember they go on visits and to parties at
the sheriffs, the minister's, and the solicitor's, very
often; we must let her go decently dressed."</p>

<p>"Oh, I never heard before that daughters must
cost money. It is a brand-new rule you have hit upon;
and what is it coming to?"</p>

<p>"He who will not sow, J&#228;ger, shall not reap."</p>

<p>"Yes, don't you think it looks like a fine harvest&mdash;this
country Adonis there in the office, who
casts sheep's eyes at her&mdash;a poor clerk who does
not have to pass an examination! But he is so quick
at the partition of inheritances, ha, ha."</p>

<p>Ma seemed to be a little overcome, and gazed
before her hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Ye-es, Thinka wrote that; he is so quick in
the partition of inheritances, he is! Don't you think
that was rather a nice introduction by her for him?"
He hummed. "It is clear as mud that she is taken
with him; otherwise your sister-in-law would not
have written about it as she did."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"Thinka has a gentle nature," came the answer
somewhat slowly and thoughtfully, "and is certainly
so easily hoodwinked, poor thing, warm and susceptible
as she is; but still she has now seen enough
of the world about her!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the world does not move in verse! As
Lieutenant Bausback said when he paid his debts
with old Mother Stenberg; she was exactly three
and a half times as old as he when they were married."</p>

<p>"She has always been pliable&mdash;we may hope that
she is amenable to a word from her parents. I will
write and represent to her the prospects."</p>

<p>"The prospects! Don't meddle with that, Ma!
Marriages don't grow on trees. Or what kind of
a match do you think Thinka can make up here?
When I am old and retired on a pension, it is a nice
lookout with all our daughters on our hands! Don't
let us be mad with pride, Ma, stark mad! That runs
in your blood and that of all the Zittows."</p>

<p>Ma's lips stiffened a little and her eyes looked
keenly black; but it was over in a moment. "I
think that after all we might economize on pork
and butter here in the house; it is not half so salt
as it is used in many places for servants, and then,
when the pigs&mdash;only the hams, I mean&mdash;can go
with the load to the city, then we can very likely
find some way to get the money in again. Otherwise,
I should be entirely disheartened. But if we
are to send the money, I think you ought to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
it to the post-office at once, J&#228;ger. They ought not
to see anything but that you pay cash down."</p>

<p>The captain rose and puffed. "Ten and five are
fifteen&mdash;and three are eighteen." He counted the
money out of a drawer in his desk. "We shall never
see the money again. Where are the scissors, the
scissors, I say?"</p>

<p>He began to cut the envelope for the money
letter out of an old gray wrapper of an official
letter, which he turned.</p>

<p>"Your coat and comforter are lying here, by the
stove," said Ma, when she came in again.</p>

<p>"There. Put the sealing-wax and seal in the inside
pocket, so that I shall not forget them; otherwise
I must pay for sealing."</p>

<p>It was as if the captain's bad humor had been
swept away when he came back hastily from the
post-office. He had found a letter from Inger-Johanna,
and immediately began to peep into it; but
it became too dark.</p>

<p>His coat was off in a trice, and, with his hat still
on, he began eagerly to read by the newly lighted
candle.</p>

<p>"Ma! Ma! Tell Ma to come in at once&mdash;and
another candle!"</p>

<p>He could not see any more, as the candle made
a halo of obscurity, and they had to wait till the
wick burned up again.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>Ma came in, turning down her sleeves after the
baking.</p>

<p>"Now you shall hear," he said.</p>

<p class="p3t">That such a ball cannot last longer! Aunt would
like to be one of the first to leave, so during the
cotillion I sit in constant anxiety lest she shall order
the sleigh. Then I am examined; but then, it is now
no longer as it was the first two or three times we
drove home, when I chattered and blabbed out
every possible thing, turned my soul and all my
feelings inside out as a pocket into aunt's bosom.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was at my seventh, and am already
engaged way into the ninth; which still will not be
my last, I hope, this winter (I led five times). Yesterday,
also, I happily escaped Lieutenant Mein,
the one with J&#246;rgen's bridle in his mouth, who has
begun to want to make sure of me for the cotillion,
as he says. He sits and stands in the companies at
home at aunt's (which is all he does, as there is not
a word in his mouth), and only looks and glowers
at me.</p>

<p>Well, you should see my dancing cards! I think
I have led a third part of all the dances this winter.
Aunt has made me a present of a sash buckle which
is beautiful, and, with all the dark yellow stones, improves
the dress wonderfully. Aunt has taste; still
we never agree when I dress. Old Aunt Alette was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
up here yesterday, and I got her on my side. So I was
relieved from having earrings dangling about my
ears; they felt as if two bits of a bridle rein were
hanging behind me, and then I must be allowed to
have sleeves wide enough to move my arm if I am
not to feel like a wooden doll.</p>

<p>You must know that I have grown three inches
since I left home. But never in my life have I really
known what it is to exist, I believe, till this winter.
When I shut my eyes, it is as if I can see in a dream
a whole series of balls, with chandeliers under which
music is floating, and I am dancing, and am led
through the throng, which seems to make way for
me.</p>

<p>I understand how Aunt Eleonore must have felt,
she who was so beautiful, and whom they say I resemble
so; she died after a ball, Aunt Alette says;
it must have been of joy. There is nothing like
dancing; nothing like seeing them competing for
engagements, kneeling, as it were, with their eyes,
and then becoming confused when I answer them
in the way they don't expect.</p>

<p>And how many times do you really think now
I have heard that I have such wonderful black hair,
such wonderful firm eyes, such a superb bearing;
how many times do you think it has been said in
the most delicate manner and in the crudest? Aunt
has also begun to admire; I could wish that the
whole winter, my whole life (so long as I am beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
no longer), were one single ball, like the Polish
count who drove over sugar.</p>

<p>And then I have always such a desire to die after
every time, when I am lying and thinking of it, and,
as it were, hear the music in my ears, until I come
to think of the next one.</p>

<p>For that I am going to have a new dress, light
yellow with black; that and white are most becoming
to me, aunt says, and then again, new yellow silk
shoes, buttoned up to the ankles; aunt says that my
high instep betrays race, and that I feel I have;
truly, I don't mind speaking right out what I think;
and it is so amusing to see people open their eyes
and wonder what sort of a person I am.</p>

<p>I really begin to suspect that several of our gentlemen
have never seen a living pig, or a duck, or
a colt (which is the prettiest thing I know). They
become so stupid as soon as I merely name something
from the country; it might be understood if
I said it in French&mdash;<i>un canard</i>, <i>un cheval</i>, <i>un cochon</i>,
<i>une vache</i>.</p>

<p>Student Grip contends that of those who have
been born in the city not one in ten has ever seen
a cow milked. He also provokes aunt by saying that
everything which happens in French is so much
finer, and thinks that we like to read and cry over
two lovers who jump into the water from <i>Pont Neuf</i>;
but only let the same thing happen here at home,
from Vaterland's bridge, then it is vulgar; and indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
I think he is often right. Aunt has to smile.
And however much she still says he lacks in polished
manners and inborn culture, she is amused
at him. And so they are everywhere, for he is invited
out every single day in the week.</p>

<p>He generally comes Sunday afternoons and for
coffee, for then he is sure that both aunt and I are
bored, he says (yes, horribly; now, how can he know
that?), and that he is not obliged to walk on stilts,
and tell lies among the blue teacups.</p>

<p>And then he and aunt are amusing with a vengeance,
when he speaks freely, and aunt opposes him
and takes him down. For he thinks for himself always;
that I can see when he is sitting with his head
on one side and gently stirring his spoon in his cup.
It makes one smile, for if he means No, you can see
it from the top of his head long before he says it.</p>

<p>He is not a little talked about in the city as one
of the worst of the Student Society in being zealous
for all their wild ideas. But aunt finds him piquant,
and thinks that youth must be suffered to sow its
wild oats. On the contrary, uncle says that this kind
is more ruinous for a young man's future than the
worst transgressions, since it destroys his capacity
for discipline.</p>

<p>What he thinks of me I should like to know.
Sometimes he asks, impertinently, "You are going
to the ball this evening, I suppose, Miss J&#228;ger?"</p>

<p>But I have it out with him to the best of my ability,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
ask aunt for advice about some fancy work, and
yawn so comfortably, and look out of the window
just when he is most excited. I see very well it provokes
him, and the last time he asked if Miss J&#228;ger
would not abstract her thoughts from the next ball
for a moment.</p>

<p>Uncle is often cross at his perverseness, and contends
that he is a disagreeable person; but I don't
believe he would readily let him go from the office,
since he is so capable.</p>

<p>Uncle lives only in his work; he is so tremendously
noble. You should hear how he can go and
worry for the least fault or want of punctuality in his
office.</p>

<p class="p3t">"I think the devil is in the fellow&mdash;now he <i>is</i> governor,"
the captain declared. "He has reached the
highest grade and can't be removed, and has no
need to worry."</p>

<p>"Poor Josiah," sighed Ma, "he was always the
most sensitive of my brothers; but the best head."</p>

<p>"Yes, the judge at Ryfylke took both force and
will for his part."</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A fortnight later they were surprised by a letter
from the governor's wife, with one from Inger-Johanna
enclosed.</p>

<p>The governor's lady must, in any event, be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
to keep her dear Inger-Johanna at least a year
longer; she had become indispensable both to her
and the governor, so that it was even difficult for
them to realize that she could have another home.</p>

<p class="p3t">She has spoiled her uncle by the young life she has
brought into the house. My dear Zittow with his
scrupulous conscientiousness is overburdened with
anxieties and responsibilities in his great office, and
is sadly in need of amusements and recreation after
so many wakeful nights. Nay, so egotistical are we,
that I will propose that we divide her in the most
unjust manner&mdash;that she shall make a visit home
this summer, but only to come down to us again.
Anything else would be a great disappointment.</p>

<p>But do not let us bring a possibly unnecessary
apple of discord upon the carpet too easily; it
might turn out like the treaty between the great
powers about the beautiful island in the Mediterranean;
during the diplomatic negotiations it vanished.
And indeed I lack very little of being ready
to guarantee that our dear subject of dispute will
in a short time herself rule over a home, which will
be in proportion to what she with her nature and
beauty can lay claim to.</p>

<p>That I, as her aunt, should be somewhat blindly
partial to her, I can hardly believe; at least I can
cite an experienced, well-informed person of the
same mind in our common friend, Captain R&#246;nnow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
who last week came here with the royal family
from Stockholm, and, in parenthesis be it said&mdash;it
must be between us&mdash;is on the point of having
an extraordinary career. He was thoroughly
enthusiastic at seeing Inger-Johanna again, and
declared that she was a perfect beauty and a born
lady, who was sure to excite attention in circles
which were even above the common, and much
more which we ought not to let our dear child
hear. I can only add that on leaving he warmly,
and with a certain anxiety, recommended me to
keep and still further develop her.</p>

<p>If not just in his first youth, he is at least perhaps
<i>the</i>, or at any rate one of the, most elegant
and most distinguished men in the army, and it
would not be difficult for him to win even the most
pretentious.</p>

<p class="p3t">"No, I should say that, by George. Well, Ma,"
said he, winking, "what do you say now? Now, I
think it is all going on well."</p>

<p>The captain took a swinging march over the
floor, and then fell upon Inger-Johanna's letter.</p>

<p class="p3t"><span class="smcap">Dear Parents</span>,&mdash;Now I must tell you something.
Captain R&#246;nnow has been here. He came
just as aunt had a reception. He looks twice as
handsome and brave as he did when he was at our
house at Gilje, and I saw plainly that he started a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
little when he got his eye on me, even while he
stopped and paid his respects to aunt.</p>

<p>My heart beat rapidly, you must know, as soon
as I saw him again; for I was really half afraid that
he would have forgotten me.</p>

<p>But he came up and took both my hands and
said very warmly, "The bud which I last saw at
Gilje is now blossomed out."</p>

<p>I blushed a little, for I knew very well that it was
he who from the first brought it about that I came
here.</p>

<p>But I call that finished manners and an easy,
straightforward way of conducting himself. Entertaining
as he was, he never lost a particle of his
grand manly dignity, and there was hardly a question
of paying attention to any other person than
to him in particular the whole evening. I must
admit that hereafter I shall have another standard
for a real gentleman whom I would call a man,
and there are certainly many who do not come up
to it.</p>

<p>Aunt has also expatiated on his manner; I believe
she was flattered because he was so kind and
cordial to me, she has ever since been in such excellent
humor.</p>

<p>After that he was here daily. He had so much
to tell us about life in Stockholm and at the court,
and always talked to me about you at home, about
father, who although he was older&mdash;</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p class="p3t">"Much, much older, yes," put in the captain
eagerly, "about four or five years, at least."</p>

<p class="p3t">&mdash;always was his never-to-be-forgotten friend.</p>

<p>You can believe those were pleasant evenings.
Aunt understands such things. There is a great void
since he is gone. Aunt thinks so, too. We have sat
talking about him, and hardly anything else than
him, these two evenings since he went away.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening Grip came again. We have
not seen him at all since the first time Captain
R&#246;nnow was here. And can any one imagine such
a man? He seems to see nothing in him. He sat
and contradicted, and was so cross and disagreeable
the whole evening that aunt was quite tired of
him. He argued about living externally, hollow
drum, and some such things, as if it were not just
the genuine manliness and naturalness that one
must value so much in Captain R&#246;nnow.</p>

<p>Oh, I lay half the night angry. He sat playing
with his teacup and talked about people who could
go through the world with a silk ribbon of phrases
and compliments: that one could flatter to death
a sound understanding, so that at last there was
left only a plucked&mdash;I plainly heard him mumble&mdash;wild
goose. Dreadful insolence! I am sure he
meant me.</p>

<p>When he had gone aunt also said that hereafter
she should refuse to receive him, when there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
no other company present; she was tired of his
performances <i>en t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te</i>; that sort of men must
have a certain restraint put upon them. He will
never have any kind of a career, she thought, he
carries his own notions too high.</p>

<p>However, it will be very tiresome if he stays
away; for with all his peculiarities he is very often
a good war comrade for me against aunt.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter VI</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> captain had kept the cover of his old
large meerschaum pipe polished with chalk
for three days, without being willing to take it
down from the shelf; he had trimmed and put in
new mouthpieces, and held a feast of purification
on the remainder, as well as on all the contents of
the tobacco table, the ash receiver, the tobacco
stems, and lava-like scrapings from the pipe. He
had let the sexton do his best at tuning the clavichord,
and put two seats, painted white, on the
stoop. The constantly neglected lattice-work around
the garden now glistened here and there with fresh
white palings, like single new teeth which are stuck
between a whole row of old gray ones. The walks
in the garden must be swept and garnished, the
yard was cleaned up, and, finally, the cover put on
the well, which was to have been done all the
years when the children were small.</p>

<p>It was the captain who, in an almost vociferous
good humor, was zealously on the move everywhere.</p>

<p>Sometimes he took a kind of rest and stood
puffing on the steps or in the window of the large
room which looked down toward the country
highway; or in the shades of the evening he took
a little turn down to the gate and sat there on the
stone fence with his pipe. If any one passed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
going south, he would say, "Are you going to
the store to buy a plug of tobacco, Lars? If you
meet a fine young lady in a cariole, greet her from
the captain at Gilje; it is my daughter who is coming
from the city."</p>

<p>If the person was some poor old crone of the
other sex, to her astonishment a copper coin fell
down on the road before her: "There, Kari; there,
Siri: you may want something to order a crutch
carriage with."</p>

<p>A surprise which was so much the greater as the
captain at other times cherished a genuine liking
for flaying old beggar women. The whole stock of
tempestuous oaths and of abusive words coined in
the inspiration of the moment, which was in his
blood from the drill-ground and military life, must
now and then have an outbreak. The old women
who went on crutches were long accustomed to this
treatment, and knew what to expect when they were
going away from the house, after having first got a
good load in their bags in the kitchen. It was like
a tattoo about their ears, accompanied by Pasop's
wild barking.</p>

<p>But in these days, while he was going about in
joyful expectation and awaiting his daughter's return
home, he was what made him a popular man
both in the district and among his men, straightforward
and sportive, something of the old gay Peter
J&#228;ger.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>The captain had just been in again in the afternoon
and tried the concert pitch on the clavichord,
which was constantly lowering, and compared his
deep bass with its almost soundless rumbling G,
when J&#246;rgen thought he saw, through the window,
a movable spot on one of the light bits of the
highway, which was visible even on the other side
of the lake.</p>

<p>The captain caught up his field-glasses, rushed
out on the steps and in again, called to Ma&mdash;and
afterwards patiently took his post at the open window,
while he called Ma in again every time they
came into the turns.</p>

<p>Down there it did not go so quickly. Svarten
stopped of his own accord at every man he met on
the way; and then Great-Ola must explain.</p>

<p>A young lady with a duster tightly fastened
about her waist, parasol and gloves, and such a
fine brass-bound English trunk on the back of the
cariole, was in itself no common thing. But that it
was the daughter of the captain at Gilje who was
coming home raised the affair up to the sensational,
and the news was therefore well spread over
the region when, toward evening, the cariole had
got as far as the door at home.</p>

<p>There stood mother and father and J&#246;rgen and
Thea and the sub-officer, Tronberg, with his small
bag yonder at the corner of the house, and the farm-hands
and girls inside the passageway&mdash;and Great-Ola<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
was cheated out of lifting the young lady down
on the steps, for she herself jumped from the cariole
step straight into the arms of her father, and then
kissed her mother and hugged Thea and pulled
J&#246;rgen by the hair a little forced dance around on
the stairs, so that he should feel the first impression
of her return home.</p>

<p>Yes, it was the parasol she had lost on the steps
and which a bare-footed girl came up with; Ma had
a careful eye upon it&mdash;the costly, delicate, fringed
parasol with long ivory handle had been lying there
between the steps and the cariole wheel.</p>

<p>The captain took off her duster himself&mdash;The
hair, the dress, the gloves; that was the way she
looked, a fine grown lady from head to foot.</p>

<p>And so they had the Gilje sun in the room!</p>

<p>"I have been sitting and longing all day for the
smell of the <i>petum</i> and to see a little cloud of smoke
about your head, father&mdash;I think you are a little
stouter&mdash;and then your dress-coat&mdash;I always
thought of you in the old shiny one. And mother&mdash;and
mother!" She rushed out after her into the
pantry, where she stayed a long time.</p>

<p>Then she came out more quietly.</p>

<p>A hot fire was blazing in the kitchen. There stood
Marit, a short, red-cheeked mountain girl, with
white teeth and small hands, stirring the porridge so
that the sweat dropped from her face; she knew very
well that Great-Ola would have it so that fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
men could dance on the surface, and now she got the
help of the young lady. After that Inger-Johanna
must over and spin on Torbj&#246;rg's spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>The captain only went with her and looked on
with half moistened eyes, and when they came in
again Inger-Johanna got the bottle from the sideboard,
and gave each of them out there a dram in
honor of her return.</p>

<p>The supper-table was waiting in the sitting-room
on a freshly laid cloth&mdash;red mountain trout and her
favorite dish, strawberries and cream.</p>

<p class="p3t">They must not think of waking her, so tired as she
was last night, father had said.</p>

<p>And therefore Thea had sat outside of the
threshold from half-past six, waiting to hear any
noise, so that she could rush in with the tray and
little cakes, for Inger-Johanna was to have her
coffee in bed.</p>

<p>J&#246;rgen kept her company, taken up with studying
the singular lock on her trunk, and then with
scanning the light, delicate patent leather shoes. He
rubbed them on his forehead and his nose, after
having moistened them with his breath.</p>

<p>Now she was waking up in there, and open flew
the door for J&#246;rgen, Thea, and Pasop, and afterwards
Torbj&#246;rg with the cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Yes, she was at home now.</p>

<p>The fragrance of the hay came in through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
open window, and she heard them driving the rumbling
loads into the barn.</p>

<p>And when she saw, from the window, the long
narrow lake in the valley down below, and all the
mountain peaks which lifted themselves so precipitously
up towards the heavens over the light fog on
the other side, she understood some of her mother's
feeling that here it was cramped, and that it was
two hundred long miles to the city. But then it was
so fragrant and beautiful&mdash;and then, she was really
home at Gilje.</p>

<p>She must go out and lie in the hay, and let J&#246;rgen
hold the buck that was inclined to butt, so she
could get past, and then look at his workshop and
the secret hunting gun he was making out of the
barrel and lock of an old army gun.</p>

<p>It was a special confidence to his grown-up sister,
for powder and gun were most strictly forbidden
him, which did not prevent his having his arsenals
of his father's coarse-grained cartridge powder hidden
in various places in the hills.</p>

<p>And then she must be with Thea and find out
all about the garden, and with her father on his
walks here and there; they went up by the cow-path,
with its waving ferns, white birch stems, and
green leaves, over the whole of the sloping ridge
of Gilje.</p>

<p>It was like a happy, almost giddy, intoxication
of home-coming for three or four days.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>It came to be more like every-day life, when Ma
began to talk about this and that of the household
affairs and to make Inger-Johanna take part in her
different cares and troubles.</p>

<p>What should be done with J&#246;rgen? They must
think of having him go to the city soon. Ma had
thought a good deal about writing to Aunt Alette
and consulting with her. Father must not be frightened
about spending too much money. If Aunt
Alette should conclude to take him to board, then
it wouldn't involve the terrible immediate outlay
of money. They could send many kinds of provisions
there, butter and cheese, <i>fladbr&#246;d</i>, dried meat,
and bacon as often as there was an opportunity.</p>

<p>She must talk with father about this sometime
later in the winter, when she had heard what Aunt
Alette thought.</p>

<p>And with Thinka they had gone through a great
deal. Ma had had all she could do to keep father
out of it&mdash;you know how little he can bear annoyances&mdash;and
she had found it a matter almost of life
and death on Wednesdays to intercept J&#246;rgen, when
he brought the mail, to get hold of Thinka's letters.
This spring Ma had written time after time,
and represented to her what kind of a future she
was preparing for herself, if she, in weakness and
folly, gave way to her rash feelings for this clerk,
Aas.</p>

<p>But in the beginning, you see, there came some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
letters back, which were very melancholy. One could
live even in poorer circumstances, she wrote,&mdash;it
seems that there was a rather doubtful prospect of
his getting a situation as a country bailiff that she
had set her hopes on.</p>

<p>Ma had placed it seriously before her how such
a thing as that might end. Suppose he was sick or
died, where would she and perhaps a whole flock
of children take refuge?</p>

<p>"It depends on overcoming the first emotion of
the fancy. Now she is coming home in the autumn,
and it could be wished that she had gotten over her
feelings. My brother Birger is so headstrong; but
maybe it was for the best that, as my sister-in-law
writes, as soon as he got a hint of the state of affairs,
he gave Aas his dismissal and sent him packing
that very day. The last two or three letters show
that Thinka is quieter."</p>

<p>"Thinka is horribly meek," exclaimed Inger-Johanna
with flashing eyes. "I believe they could
pickle her and put her down and tie up the jar; she
would not grumble. If Uncle Birger had done so
to me, I would not have stayed there a day longer."</p>

<p>"Inger-Johanna! Inger-Johanna!" Ma shook
her head. "You have a dangerous, spoiled temper.
It is only the very, very smallest number of us
women who are able to do what they would like to."</p>

<p class="p3t">The captain did not disdain the slightest occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
to bring forward his daughter just come home from
the city.</p>

<p>He had turned the time to account, for in the
beginning of the next week he would be obliged to
go on various surveys up on the common land and
then to the drills.</p>

<p>They had made a trip down to the central part
of the district, to Pastor Horn's, and on the way
stopped and called on Sexton Semmelinge and Bardon
Kleven, the bailiff. They had been to Dr. Bauman,
the doctor of the district; and now on Sunday
they were invited to Sheriff G&#252;lcke's&mdash;a journey
of thirty-five miles down the valley.</p>

<p>It was an old house of a <i>cal&#234;che</i>, repaired a hundred
times, which was drawn out of its hiding-place,
and within whose chained together arms Svarten
and the dun horse&mdash;the blind bay had long since
been sent away&mdash;were to continue their three-months-long
attempt to agree in the stall.</p>

<p>If the beasts had any conception, it must most
likely have been that it was an enormously heavy
plough they were drawing, in a lather, up and down
hill, with continual stoppings to get breath and let
those who were sitting in it get in and out.</p>

<p>If there was anything the captain adhered to, it
was military punctuality, and at half-past four in
the morning the whole family in full dress, the captain
and J&#246;rgen with their pantaloons turned up,
the ladies with their dresses tucked up, were wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
on foot down the Gilje hills&mdash;they were some
of the worst on the whole road&mdash;while Great-Ola
drove the empty carriage down to the highway.</p>

<p>The dun horse was better fitted for pulling than
holding back, so that it was Svarten that must be
depended on in the hills, and Great-Ola, the captain,
and J&#246;rgen must help.</p>

<p>It was an exceedingly warm day, and the carriage
rolled on in an incessant dense, stifling dust of
the road about the feet of the horses and the wheels.
But then it was mainly down hill, and they rested
and got breath every mile.</p>

<p>At half-past one they had only to cross the ferry
and a short distance on the other side again up to
the sheriff's farm.</p>

<p>On the ferry a little toilet was temporarily made,
and the captain took his new uniform coat out of
the carriage box and put it on. Except that J&#246;rgen
had greased his pantaloons from the wheels, not a
single accident had happened on the whole trip.</p>

<p>As soon as they came up on the hill, they saw
the judge's carriage roll up before them through the
gate, and in the yard they recognized the doctor's
cariole and the lawyer's gig. There stood the sheriff
himself, helping the judge's wife out of the carriage;
his chief clerk and his daughters were on the steps.</p>

<p>So far as the ladies were concerned, there must,
of course, be a final toilet and a change of clothes
before they found themselves presentable. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the two daughters of the lawyer was in a red and the
other in a clear white dress, and of the three daughters
of the judge, two were in white and one in
blue.</p>

<p>That a captain's daughter, with his small salary,
came in brown silk with patent leather shoes, could
only be explained by the special circumstances, suggested
Mrs. Scharfenberg in the ear of old Miss
Horn of the parsonage; it was, in all probability,
one of the governor's lady's, which had been made
over down in the city.</p>

<p>The fact was that young Horn who, it was expected,
would be chaplain to his father, the minister,
treated Inger-Johanna in a much more complimentary
manner than he showed toward Mrs.
Scharfenberg's daughter, Bine, to whom he was as
good as engaged; and the chief clerk did not seem
to be blind to her. They both ran to get a chair for
her.</p>

<p>The sofa was assigned to the judge's wife and to
Ma, as a matter of course. Mrs. Scharfenberg did
not think this quite right either, since her husband
had been nominated second for the judgeship of
Sogn; and that the sheriff had to-day also invited
the rich Mrs. Silje was, her husband said, only a bid
for popularity: she was still always what she was&mdash;widow
of the country storekeeper, Silje.</p>

<p>It was a long time to sit and exchange compliments,
before the mainstay of the dinner, the sheriff's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
roast, was sufficiently and thoroughly done, and
he got a nod from his wife to ask the company out
to the table in the large room.</p>

<p>The only one who laughed and talked before
the ice was fairly broken was Inger-Johanna, who
chatted with the judge and then with Horn and the
army doctor.</p>

<p>Ma pursed her lips a little uneasily, as she sat on
the sofa and pretended to be absorbed in conversation
with Mrs. Brinkman; she knew what they all
would say about her afterwards.</p>

<p class="p3t">It had been a rather warm dinner. Through the
abundant provision of the sheriff, the fatigue and
hunger after the journey had given place to an extremely
lively mood spiced with speeches and songs.</p>

<p>They had sat a long time at the table before the
scraping of the judge's chair finally gave the signal
for the breaking up.</p>

<p>The sheriff now stood stout and beaming during
the thanks for the meal, and demanded and received
his tribute as host&mdash;a kiss from each one of the
young ladies.</p>

<p>The masculine part of the company distributed
themselves with their coffee-cups out in the cool
hall and on the stairs, or went with their tobacco
pipes into the yard, while the ladies sat around the
coffee-table in the parlor.</p>

<p>The judge talked somewhat loudly with the sheriff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
and the captain, red and hot, stood a little way
out in the yard, cooling himself.</p>

<p>The doctor came up and clapped him on the
shoulder. "The sheriff really took the spigot out of
the bung to-day: we had excellent drink."</p>

<p>"Oh, if one only had a pipe now, and could go
and loaf."</p>

<p>"You have got one in your hand, man."</p>

<p>"Really? But filled, you see."</p>

<p>"You just went in and filled it."</p>

<p>"I? No, really; but a light, you see, a light."</p>

<p>"I say, J&#228;ger, Scharfenberg is already up taking
a nap."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; but the bay, you cheated me shamefully
in that."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Peter; your cribber ate himself
half out of my stall&mdash;That Madeira was strong."</p>

<p>"Rist&mdash;my daughter, Inger-Johanna&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you see, Peter, I forgive you that you are
a little cracked about her; she may make stronger
heads than yours whirl round."</p>

<p>"She is beautiful&mdash;beautiful." His voice was assuming
an expression of serious pathos.</p>

<p>The two military men, at a sedate, thoughtful
pace, walked back to one of the sleeping-rooms in
the second story.</p>

<p>In the hall, tall Buchholtz, the judge's chief
clerk, was standing, stiff and silent, against the wall,
with his coffee-cup in his hand; he was pondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
whether anyone would notice anything wrong about
him. He had been in the coffee room with the
ladies and tried to open a conversation with Miss
J&#228;ger.</p>

<p>"Have you been here long, Miss J&#228;ger?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks."</p>

<p>"How lo-ong do you intend to stay here?"</p>

<p>"Till the end of August."</p>

<p>"Don't you miss the city u-p here?"</p>

<p>"No, not at all."</p>

<p>She turned from him, and began to talk with her
mother. The same questions had now been asked
her by all the gentlemen.</p>

<p>The irreproachable Candidate Horn stood by
the door enjoying his coffee and the defeat of the
chief clerk. He was lying in wait for an opportunity
to have a chat with Inger-Johanna, but found an insurmountable
obstacle in the judge's well-read wife,
who began to talk with her about French literature,
a region in which he felt he could not assert
himself.</p>

<p>At the request of the sheriff, a general exit took
place later. The ladies must go out on the porch
and see the young people playing "the widower
seeking a mate."</p>

<p>Mrs. Silje sat there, broad and good-natured after
all the good eating, and enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"No, but he did not catch her this time, no.
Make the strap around your waist tighter, next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
time, sir!" She smiled when the chief clerk's attempt
to catch Inger-Johanna failed; "she is such
a fine young lady to try for."</p>

<p>Mrs. Scharfenberg found that there was a draught
on the stairs, and as she moved into the hall, where
the sheriff's wife, always an invalid, sat wrapped up
in her shawl, she could not but say to her and the
judge's wife that the young lady's reckless manner
of running&mdash;so that you could even see the stockings
above her shoes&mdash;smacked rather much of being
free. But she was sure Mrs. Silje did not find it in
the least unbecoming. She remarked sharply, "She
had herself gone so many times on the sunny hillside
with the other girls, raking hay in her smock
before she was married to the trader."</p>

<p>Ma, indeed, gave Inger-Johanna an anxious hint
as soon as she could reach her.</p>

<p>"You must not run so violently, child. It does
not look well&mdash;you must let yourself be caught."</p>

<p>"By that chief clerk&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>Ma sighed.</p>

<p>They kept on with the game till tea time, when
those who had been missing after dinner again
showed themselves in a rested condition, ready to
begin a game of Boston for the evening.</p>

<p>"But J&#246;rgen&mdash;where is J&#246;rgen?"</p>

<p>In obedience to the call, somewhat pale and in
a cold perspiration, but with a bold front, he came
down from the office building, where he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
sitting, smoking tobacco on the sly with the sheriff's
clerk and "the execution horse," whose racy designation
was due to his unpopular portion of the
sheriff's functions.</p>

<p>The game of Boston was continued after supper
with violent defeats and quite wonderful exposed
hands, between the judge, the captain, the sheriff,
and the attorney.</p>

<p>In the other room Ma sat uneasy, wondering
when father would think of breaking up&mdash;they had
a very long journey home, and it was already ten
o'clock. The sheriff had urged them in vain to
remain all night; but it didn't answer this time;
J&#228;ger had definite reasons why they must be home
again to-morrow.</p>

<p>She sat in silence, resting her hopes on the sharp
little Mrs. Scharfenberg, trusting she would soon
dare to show herself in the door of the card room.</p>

<p>But it dragged on; the other ladies were certainly
resting their hope on her.</p>

<p>She nodded to Inger-Johanna. "Can't you go
in," she whispered, "and remind your father a little
of the time&mdash;but only as if of your own accord?"</p>

<p>Finally at eleven o'clock they were sitting in the
carriage&mdash;after the sheriff had again asserted, on the
steps, his privilege of an old man towards the young
ladies. He was a real master in meeting all the playful
ways they had of escaping in order to be saved
from the smacking good-by.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>The chief clerk and Candidate Horn went with
the carriage to the gate.</p>

<p>"It was neither for your sake nor mine, Ma,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>He was driving, but turned incessantly in order
to hear the talk in the carriage, and throw in an
observation with it. J&#246;rgen and Thea, who had
kept modestly quiet the whole day, but had made
many observations, nevertheless, were now on a
high horse; Thea especially plumed herself as the
only soul who had succeeded in escaping the
sheriff.</p>

<p>And now they were on the way home in the
light, quiet July night, up hill and up hill&mdash;in
places down, foot by foot, step by step, except
where they dared to let the carriage go faster as
they came to the bottom of a hill.</p>

<p>A good level mile or two, where they could all
sit in the carriage, was passed over at a gentle jog-trot.
It was sultry with a slightly moist fragrance
from the hay-cocks, and a slight impression of twilight
over the land&mdash;Great-Ola yawned, the captain
yawned, the horses yawned, J&#246;rgen nodded,
Thea slept, wrapped up under Ma's shawl. Now
and then they were roused by the rushing of a
mountain brook, as it flowed foaming under a
bridge in the road.</p>

<p>Inger-Johanna sat dreaming, and at last saw a
yellowish brown toad before her, with small, curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
eyes and a great mouth&mdash;and then it rose up, so
puffed up and ungainly, and hopped down towards
her.</p>

<p>The horses stopped.</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe I was dreaming about the sheriff!"
said Inger-Johanna, as she woke up shivering.</p>

<p>"We must get out here," came sleepily from the
captain, "on the Rognerud hills; Ma can stay in
with Thea."</p>

<p>The day was beginning to dawn. They saw the
sun bathe the mountain tops in gold and the light
creep down the slopes. The sun lay as it were still,
and peeped at them first, till it at once bounded
over the crest in the east like a golden ball, and
colored red the wooded mountain sides and hills
on the west side, clear down to the greensward
shining with dew.</p>

<p>Still they toiled, foot by foot, up the hills.</p>

<p>On the Gilje lands the people had already been
a long time at work spreading out the hay, when
they saw them coming.</p>

<p>"It is good to be home again," declared Ma. "I
wonder if Marit has remembered to hang the trout
in the smoke."</p>

<p>Marit came rushing out of the door of the
porch: "There was a fine city traveller came this
way last night! He who was here two years ago, and
had his shoes mended. I did not know anything
better than to let him sleep in the blue chamber."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, ho! Student Grip! I suppose he is on his
way towards home."</p>

<p>Ma looked at once at Inger-Johanna; she fell
into a reverie. She stepped hurriedly out of the
carriage.</p>

<p>"J&#228;ger is going surveying to-morrow a long distance
into the mountains,&mdash;clear over to the Gr&#246;nnelid
<i>saeters</i>," Ma said to him, when he came out
of his room in the morning, "and there is so much
that must be done."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;oh&mdash;and to-morrow early." The student
hesitated. "My plan is to go home over the mountain,
as I did last time&mdash;to get a little really fresh
air, away from the stuffy town air and the lawbooks."</p>

<p>"But then you could go with J&#228;ger? It will be
thirty-five to forty miles you could go together
up in the mountains&mdash;and for J&#228;ger, it would be a
real pleasure to have company. You won't have any
objection, I suppose, to my putting up something
for you to eat by the way?"</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;I thank you very much for all your
kindness."</p>

<p>"She will not have me, that is plain," he muttered,
while he wandered about the yard during the
forenoon; they were all asleep except the mistress.
But he did not come here to escort the captain.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, when it began to grow a little
cool, the captain, Inger-Johanna, J&#246;rgen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Student Grip took the lonely road to the mill.
Great-Ola and Aslak, the crofter, went with them&mdash;something
was to be done to the mill-wheel,
now that the stream was almost dry.</p>

<p>They stood there studying eagerly how the
wheel could best be raised off the axis.</p>

<p>"That J&#246;rgen, that J&#246;rgen, he has got the hang
of the wheel!" exclaimed the captain. "You can
get Tore, the joiner, to help, Ola, as soon as you
come back with the horses from the mountain&mdash;and
let J&#246;rgen show you how: he understands it,
he does&mdash;if it is only not a book, he is clever
enough."</p>

<p>"You will have to take hold of your forelock and
try and cram, J&#246;rgen; do as you did with the rye-pudding&mdash;the
sooner it is eaten, the sooner it is
over," said Grip, to comfort him.</p>

<p>"Look here, I came near forgetting the fish-lines
for to-morrow. You will have to go down to
the store this evening, J&#246;rgen. We catch the trout
ourselves up there, as you will see," said the captain,
turning to Grip.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;yes," he puffed, while they were
sauntering toward home together. "I certainly need
to go to the mountains now, I always come down
again three or four pounds lighter."</p>

<p>"I have wandered about that part of the country
from the time I was a schoolboy," remarked Grip.
"We must put Lake Bygdin into the geography&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
it was discovered only a few years ago, in
the middle of a broad mountain plateau, which only
some reindeer hunter or other knew anything
about."</p>

<p>"Not laid down on any map, no&mdash;as blank as in
the interior of Africa, marked out as unexplored,"
the captain pointed out. "But then there is traffic
going on between the districts, both of people and
cattle, and the mountains have their names from
ancient times down among the common people."</p>

<p>"True, the natives also knew the interior of Africa,
but on that account it is not called discovered by
the civilized world," said Grip, smiling. "I always
wondered what could be found in such a mysterious
region in the middle of the country. There might
be a great deal there: valleys entirely deserted from
ancient times&mdash;old, sunken timber halls, and then
wild reindeer rushing here and there over the
wastes."</p>

<p>"Yes, shooting," agreed the captain; "we get
many a tender reindeer steak from over there."</p>

<p>"It was that which attracted me, when I met the
reindeer hunter two years ago: I wanted to explore
a little, to see what there was there."</p>

<p>"Exactly like all that we imagined about the
city," exclaimed Inger-Johanna.</p>

<p>"You ought to go with your father part of the
way over the mountains, Miss Inger-Johanna&mdash;see
if you could find some lofty bower."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>"That is an idea, not at all stupid," broke in the
captain, "not impossible, not at all! You could ride
all the way to the Gr&#246;nnelid <i>saeters</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah, if you could carry that through, father!"
she exclaimed earnestly. "Now I have also taken
a fancy to see what there is there&mdash;I believe we
always thought the world ended over there at our
own <i>saeter</i> pastures."</p>

<p>"I have some blankets on the pack-saddle, and
where they can get a roof over my head there will be
room enough for you too.&mdash;Come, come, Morten,
will you let people alone!" The captain took out
a roll of tobacco and held a piece out to the stable
goat, that was coming, leaping, towards them from
the yard. "There, mumble-beard&mdash;he will have
his allowance, the rascal.&mdash;Ma," he called, when he
saw her coming from the storehouse, "what would
you say if I should take Inger-Johanna with me
to-morrow? Then they will have company home
on Friday with Ola and the horses&mdash;she and J&#246;rgen."</p>

<p>"But, dear J&#228;ger, why should she go up there?"</p>

<p>"She can pass the night at Gr&#246;nnelid <i>saeter</i>."</p>

<p>"Such a fatiguing trip! It is absolutely without
a path and wild where you must go."</p>

<p>"She can ride the horse a good ways beyond the
<i>saeter</i>. Svarten will go as steady as a minister with
her and the pack-saddle&mdash;both on the mountain
and in the bog. I will take the dun horse myself."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
He had become very eager at the prospect of taking
her with him. "Certainly, you shall go. You
must put a good lot in the provision bag, Ma. We
must be off early to-morrow at five o'clock. Tronberg
will join us with a horse farther up, so there
will be a way of giving you a mount also, Grip."</p>

<p>Grip started on a run with J&#246;rgen towards the
yard, finally caught him, and drove him in through
the open kitchen window.</p>

<p class="p3t">The captain, with his neck burned brown, toiled,
red and sweating in his shirt-sleeves, in the mountain
fields up under Torsknut.</p>

<p>The packhorses went first with Inger-Johanna
and all the equipment, and by the side of the captain
walked some farmers who carried their coats on
sticks over their shoulders on account of the heat,
and eagerly pointed out bounds and marks, every
time they stopped and he was to draw some line
or other as a possible connection.</p>

<p>They had passed the night at the Gr&#246;nnelid <i>saeters</i>
and been out on the moors making a sketch
survey at five o'clock in the morning, had ridden
over flat mountain wastes among willow thickets,
while the horses, step by step, waded across windings
of the same river.</p>

<p>Now they stopped again after a steep ascent to
wait for Tronberg, whom they had seen below on
the hills.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>The captain took out his spy-glass, and after a
cursory glance over the shining icy fields which lay
like a distant sea of milk, turned it farther and
farther down.</p>

<p>The perspiration rolled in great drops off his
forehead and eyelids, so that the glass was blurred,
and he was obliged to wipe it again with his large,
worn silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>Then he rested the spy-glass on the back of the
packhorse, and held it still a long time. "That
must be the Rognelid folk, after all, who are moving
there west of Braekstad heights. What do you say?"</p>

<p>The people to whom he turned needed only to
shade their eyes to agree with him that it was the
opposite party whom they were to meet the next
morning at Lake Tiske. But they were too polite
fellows to express it otherwise than by saying in a flattering
manner, "What a spy-glass the captain has!"</p>

<p>During this surveying business he was borne,
so to speak, on a royal cushion by the anxious interests
of both parties to the contest; it contributed
to the pleasure he took in his trips in the mountains
in summer to feel himself in that way lifted
up by their hands.</p>

<p>"Have you been fishing, Tronberg?" he shouted
when the head of the subaltern's "Rauen" appeared
nodding down in the steep path. "Trout! Caught
to-day?"</p>

<p>"This morning, Captain."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>The captain took up the string and looked at
the gills. "Yes, they are to-day's."</p>

<p>The subaltern took off his hat, and dried his
forehead and head. "One could easily have fried
the fish on the rocky wall in the whole of that pan
of a valley over there that I came through," Tronberg
said.</p>

<p>"Fine fish. See that, Grip,&mdash;weighs at least three
pounds."</p>

<p>"Goodness sake, the young lady here!" exclaimed
the subaltern, involuntarily bringing himself
up to a salute when Inger-Johanna turned her
horse round and looked at the shiny speckled fish
which hung on the pack-saddle.</p>

<p>But old Lars Opidalen, the one who had asked
for the survey, gently passed his coarse hand over
hers, while he counted the trout on the willow
branch. "Can such also be of the earth?" he said,
quietly wondering.</p>

<p>"Help the young lady, Lars, while she dismounts:
it is not well to ride any longer on this
smooth bare rock."</p>

<p>The path ascended, steeper and steeper, with
occasional marshy breathing places in between&mdash;it
was often entirely lost in the gray mountain.</p>

<p>The mournful cry of a fish eagle sounded over
them. It circled around, cried, and went off when
J&#246;rgen shouted at it. It must have had a nest somewhere
up on that rocky wall.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>The captain's shotgun was brought out, and
Tronberg attempted a shot, but could not get within
range. If he could only lie in wait for it behind the
great stones up here!</p>

<p>The eagle whirled around again near them with
broad, outspread wings.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a report up above on the
slope strewn with stones, and the eagle made some
vigorous, flapping strokes with its wings; it struggled
so as not to fall down.</p>

<p>The shot had gone through one wing, so that
daylight could be seen through the hole in the
feathers. The bird evidently found it difficult to
preserve its equilibrium.</p>

<p>"What a shame!&mdash;it is wounded," exclaimed
Inger-Johanna.</p>

<p>"Who shot?" demanded the captain, taken
aback.</p>

<p>"J&#246;rgen ran off with the rifle," Tronberg replied.</p>

<p>"J&#246;rgen! He can't make me believe it was his
first shot, the rogue! But he shot himself free from
a thrashing that time&mdash;for it was a good shot,
Tronberg. The rascal! He has been most strictly
forbidden to meddle with guns."</p>

<p>"Forbidden indeed," murmured Grip. "Is it not
remarkable, Miss Inger-Johanna, it is always the
forbidden thing in which we are most skilful? It
is exactly these prohibitions that constitute our
most potent education&mdash;But that is going the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of villains in growth, and leaves its marks behind&mdash;makes
men with good heads but bad characters."</p>

<p>Grip and Inger-Johanna walked ahead with the
horses. A strange, hazy warm smoke lay below over
the marshes in the afternoon: it veiled the lines
there. Up here on the mountain the air was so
sparkling clear.</p>

<p>Foot by foot, the animals picked their way over
the piles of stony d&#233;bris between the enormous fallen
masses which lay, scattered here and there, like moss-covered
gray houses, with now and then a fairy forelock
of dwarf birch upon them, while on the mountain
ledges still hung yellow tufts of saxifrage.</p>

<p>"Only see all this warped, twisted, fairy creation.
You could say that life is really turned to stone here,&mdash;and
yet it bubbles up."</p>

<p>He stopped. "Do you know what I could wish,
Miss Inger-Johanna?" There was no longer any
trace of the strain of irony which usually possessed
him. "Simply to be a schoolmaster!&mdash;teach the
children to lay the first two sticks across by their
own plain thoughts. It is the fundamental logs that
are laid the wrong way in us. They ought to be allowed
to believe just as much and as little as they
could really swallow. And to the door with the
whole host of these cherished, satisfactory prohibitions!
I should only show the results&mdash;mix powder
and matches together before their eyes till it
went into the air, and then say, 'If you please,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
J&#246;rgen, so far as I am concerned, you can go with
the two things in your pocket as much as you
like: it is you, yourself, who will be blown into the
air.' It is the sense of responsibility that is to be
cultivated while the boy is growing up, if he is to
be made a man."</p>

<p>"You have an awful lot of ideas, Grip."</p>

<p>"Crotchets, you mean? If I had any talent with
the pen,&mdash;but I am so totally dependent on word
of mouth. You see, there are only four doors, and
they are called theology, philology, medicine, and
law, and I have temporarily knocked at the last.
What I want there, I don't know. Have you heard
of the cat which they put into a glass ball and
pumped the air out? It noticed that there was something
wrong. It was troubled for breath; the air
was constantly getting thinner and thinner; and so
it put one paw on the hole. I shall also allow myself
to put one paw on the draught hole&mdash;for here
is a vacuum&mdash;not up in the skies with the poets,
of course. There it lightens and shines, and they
write about working for the people and for freedom
and for everything lofty and great in as many
directions as there are points on a compass&mdash;but
in reality, down on the earth&mdash;for a prosaic person
who would take hold and set in motion a little
of the phrases&mdash;there it is entirely closed. There
is no use for all our best thoughts and ideas in the
practical world, I can tell you; not even so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
that a man can manage to make himself unhappy
in them.</p>

<p>"And so one lives as best he can his other life
with his comrades, and re-baptizes himself in punch
with them every time he has been really untrue to
himself in the tea parties. But taste this air&mdash;every
blessed breath like a glass of the finest, finest&mdash;nay,
what shall I call it?"</p>

<p>"Punch," was the rather short answer.</p>

<p>"No, life! With this free nature one does not
feel incited to dispute. I am in harmony with the
mountain, with the sun, with all these crooked
tough birch-osiers. If people down there only were
themselves! But that they never are, except in a
good wet party when they have got themselves
sufficiently elevated from the bottom of the well.
There exists a whole freemasonry, the members
of which do not know each other except in that
form, or else in Westerman's steam baths when
Westerman whips us with fresh birch leaves in a
temperature of eighty degrees. The bath-house was
our fathers' national club, did you know that?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; I am learning a great many new
things, I think," she said, with half concealed humor.</p>

<p>"Listen, listen! The golden plover whistling,"
whispered J&#246;rgen.</p>

<p>The sound came from a little marshy spot which
was white with cotton grass.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>They stood listening.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear anything so tremendously
quiet," said Grip, "after a single little peep. There
are such peeps here and there in the country. Abel,
he died, he did&mdash;of what? Of drink, they said"&mdash;he
shook his head&mdash;"of vacuum."</p>

<p>He was walking in his shirt-sleeves, and flung
the willow stick, which he had broken off while
he was talking, far down over the rocky incline.</p>

<p>"There, Captain, see the line, as it has been from
ancient times for Opidalen," shouted old Lars&mdash;"straight,
straight along by the Notch, where we
shall go down and across the lake&mdash;straight toward
R&#246;dkampen on Torsknut&mdash;there where you see
the three green islands under the rocks, Captain."
He shook his stick in his eagerness. "For that I
shall bring witnesses&mdash;and if they were all living
here who have fished on our rights in the lake,
both in my father's and grandfather's time, there
would be a crowd of people against their villainies
in Rognelien."</p>

<p>The afternoon shadows fell into the Notch,
where the ice-water trickled down through the
cracks in the black mountain wall. Here and there
the sun still shone on patches of greenish yellow
reindeer moss, on some violet, white, or yellow little
clusters of high mountain flowers, which exemplified
the miracle of living their tinted life of beauty
up here close to the snow.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"There comes Mathis with the boat," exclaimed
old Lars.</p>

<p>The boat, which was to carry them over to the
shelter, crept like an insect far below them on the
green mirror of the lake.</p>

<p>The going down was real recreation for the captain's
rather stout body, short of breath as he was,
and the prospect of being able to indulge in his favorite
sport, fishing, contributed greatly to enlivening
his temper.</p>

<p>"We are coming here just at the right time: they
will bite," he suggested.</p>

<p>When they embarked in the square trough,
which was waiting for them down by the fishing-hut,
he had the line ready. He had already, with
great activity, taken care of the bait, carried in a
goat's horn.</p>

<p>Those of the train who could not be accommodated
in the boat went around the lake with the
horses. They saw them now and then on the crags,
while they rowed out.</p>

<p>"What do you say to a trial along the shore there
in the shade, Mathis? Don't you think they will
take the hook there?&mdash;We are not rowing so
straight over at once, I think," said the captain slyly.</p>

<p>Under the thwarts Mathis's own line was lying;
and Inger-Johanna also wanted to try her hand at it.</p>

<p>The captain put the bait on for her. But she
would not sit and wait till they reached the fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
place; she threw the line out at once and let it trail
behind the boat, while, as they rowed, she, off and
on, gave a strong pull at it.</p>

<p>"See how handy she is," exclaimed the captain;
"it is inborn&mdash;you come from a race of fishermen,
for I was brought up in the Bergen district, and my
father before me. If I had a dollar for every codfish
I have pulled out of Alverstr&#246;mmen, there would
be something worth inheriting from me&mdash;What!
what!"</p>

<p>A swirl was heard far behind in the wake. Inger-Johanna
gave a vigorous pull; the yellow belly of a
fish appeared a moment in the sunlight above the
surface of the water.</p>

<p>She continued, after the first feverish jerk upon
the line, in a half risen position, to pull it in.</p>

<p>When she lifted the shining fish high upon the
edge of the boat, she burst out into a triumphant
cry, "The first fish I have ever caught!"</p>

<p>Grip took the fish off the hook, and threw it far
off. "Then it shall also be allowed to keep its life!"</p>

<p>The captain angrily moved his heavy body, so
that it shook the boat. But that the ill-timed offering
to the deep was made for the honor of the apple
of his eye greatly mitigated the stupidity.</p>

<p>And when they got in under the knoll, where
he cast his line, he suddenly sang a verse from his
youthful recollections of the Bergen quarter, which
had slumbered in him for many a long year.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<div class="center">

<div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i>I lay basking in the sun,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>While the boat was drifting in the current,</i></div>

  <div class="i0"><i>I was giddy with my dream.</i></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>His deep bass came out with full force in the silence
under the knoll.</p>

<p>The lake was like a mirror, and the captain took
one trout after another.</p>

<p>Torsknut, with patches and fields of snow on
the summit, stood on its head deep down below
them, so that it almost caused a giddy feeling when
they looked out over the boat-rail. And when they
arrived under the cattle station, the steep green
mountain side, with all the grazing cattle, was reproduced
so clearly that they could count the horns
in the water.</p>

<p>"Nay, here the cows walk like flies on the wall,"
said the captain. "If the milk-bucket falls up there,
it will roll down to us into the boat."</p>

<p>The shelter was, in fact, nothing more than a little
mud hut on the rocky slope, and a little wooden
shed, with boulders on the roof, and a hole in it.
There the captain was to be quartered, and Inger-Johanna
was to sleep till the sun rose, and she,
with J&#246;rgen, Great-Ola, and Svarten, should go
back again to the Gr&#246;nnelid <i>saeters</i>.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>They had eaten supper&mdash;the trout and an improvised
cream porridge&mdash;and were now standing,
watching the sun set behind the great mountains.</p>

<p>The captain was going about on the turf, in
slippers and unbuttoned uniform coat, smoking his
pipe with extreme satisfaction. He stopped now and
then and gazed at the sun playing on the mountain
peaks far away.</p>

<p>Then a range of hitherto dark blue peaks took
fire in violet blushing tints, until they seemed an
entire glowing flame. And now the snow-fields became
rose-red in the east&mdash;wonderful fairy tales in
towers and castles gleamed there&mdash;the three snowy
peaks then were turned to blood, with a burning,
shining flash on top of the middle one. And again
in the distance, still unlighted, blue peaks, snow-drifts,
and glens, on which the shadows were playing.</p>

<p>J&#246;rgen was lying, with his father's spy-glass,
watching the reindeer on the ice-fields.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Miss Inger-Johanna," said Grip.
"I am going over the mountains to-night, with one
of the men to guide me. There are more people
here than the hut will accommodate. But first let
me say to you," he added in a subdued tone, "that
this open-hearted day on the high mountain has
been one of the few of my life.... I have not found
it necessary to say a single cowardly, bad witticism&mdash;nor
to despise myself," he added roughly.
"Yes, just so&mdash;just as you stand there, so fine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
erect and haughty, under the great straw hat, I shall
remember you till we meet in the city again."</p>

<p>"It is a good ten miles to Svartdalsbod," suggested
the captain, when he took leave&mdash;"always
welcome to Gilje, Grip."</p>

<p>He was already giving his farewell greetings a
good distance up the steep ascent of Torsknut.</p>

<p>"Does not seem to know fatigue, that fellow,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>She stood looking at him. The last rays of the
sun cast a pale yellow tinge in the evening with this
transparent mirroring. There was such a warm life
in her face!</p>

<p class="p3t">Some kind of an insect&mdash;a humble-bee or a
wasp&mdash;buzzed through the open window into the
room newly tinted in blue&mdash;hummed so noisily on
the window-pane that the young girl with the luxuriant
black hair and the slightly dark, clear-cut
face, who was lying sleeping into the morning, was
almost aroused.</p>

<p>She lay sound asleep on her side, after having
come home in the night. The impressions of the
mountains' summits were still playing in her brain.
She had another trout on the line&mdash;it flashed and
floundered there in the lake&mdash;Grip came up with
two sticks, which were to be placed crossways.</p>

<p>Surr-humm! straight into her face, so that she
woke up.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>The day was already far advanced.</p>

<p>There on the toilet table with white hangings
above it surrounding the glass which had been put
there for her return home, was the violet soap in
silver paper.</p>

<p>It was plainly that which attracted all the inexperienced
insects to ruin: they had found the way to
an entirely new world of flowers there and plunged
blindly headlong, believing in the discovery, without
any conception of the numerous artificial products
of the age outside of the mountain region&mdash;that
the fragrance of violets did not produce violets, but
only horrid, horrid pains in the stomach. There
plainly existed an entire confusion in their ideas, to
judge by all the disquiet and humming in and out
of those that had recently come and possibly began
to suspect something wrong and took a turn or two
up and down in the room first, before the temptation
became too great for them, and by the earlier
arrivals that slowly crept up and down on the wall
with acquired experience in life, or were lying stupefied
and floundering on the window-sill.</p>

<p>"Ish!&mdash;and straight up into the washing water."</p>

<p>She looked with a certain indignation at the cause&mdash;her
violet soap.</p>

<p>At the same time it opened a new train of thought
while she smelled it two or three times.</p>

<p>"Mother's yellow soap is more honest."</p>

<p>She quickly threw it out of the window, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
a towel carefully wiped those that had fallen on the
field of battle off the sill.</p>

<p>Later in the forenoon, Ma and Inger-Johanna
stood down in the garden, picking sugar peas for
dinner.</p>

<p>"Only the ripest, Inger-Johanna, which are becoming
too hard and woody, till your father comes
home. What will your aunt say when she hears that
we have let you go with your father so far up in the
wilderness&mdash;she certainly will not think such a trip
very inviting, or comprehend that you can be so
eloquent over stone and rocks."</p>

<p>"No, she thinks that nothing can compete with
their Tuller&#246;d," said Inger-Johanna, smiling.</p>

<p>"Pass the plate over to me, so that I may empty
it into the basket," came from Ma.</p>

<p>"So aunt writes that R&#246;nnow is going to stay all
winter in Paris."</p>

<p>"R&#246;nnow, yes&mdash;but I shall amuse myself very
well by reading aloud to her this winter <i>Gedecke's
Travels in Switzerland</i>,&mdash;and then give her small
doses of my trip."</p>

<p>"Now you are talking without thinking, Inger-Johanna.
There is always a great difference between
that which is within the circle of culture and desolate
wild tracts up here in the mountain region."</p>

<p>Ma's bonnet-covered head bowed down behind
the pea-vines.</p>

<p>"Father says that it is surely because they want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
to use him at Stockholm that he is going to perfect
himself in French."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is certainly going to become something
great. You can believe we find it ever so snug and
pleasant when we are sometimes at home alone and
I read aloud to aunt."</p>

<p>Ma's large bonnet, spotted with blue, rose up, and
with a table knife in her hand she passed the empty
plate back. "And he has the bearing which suits, the
higher he gets."</p>

<p>"Quite perfect&mdash;but I don't know how it is, one
does not care to think about him up here in the
country."</p>

<p>Ma stood a moment with the table knife in her
hand.</p>

<p>"That will do," she said, as she took up the basket,
somewhat troubled&mdash;"We shan't have many peas
this year," she added, sighing.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter VII</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> kitchen at Gilje was completely given
over to Christmas preparations.</p>

<p>There was a cold draught from the porch, an odor
in the air of mace, ginger, and cloves&mdash;a roar of
chopping-knives, and dull rumbling and beating
so that the floor shook from the wooden mortar,
where Great-Ola himself was stationed with a white
apron and a napkin around his head.</p>

<p>At the head of the long kitchen table Ma was sitting,
with a darning-needle and linen thread, sewing
collared beef, while some of the crofter women and
Thea, white as angels, were scraping meat for the
fine meat-balls.</p>

<p>There, on the kitchen bench, with bloody, murderous
arms, sat Thinka, who had recently returned
home, stuffing sausages over a large trough. It
went with great skill through the filler, and she fastened
up the ends with wooden skewers, and struggled
with one dark, disagreeable, gigantic leech after
another, while their brothers or sisters were boiling
in the mighty kettle, around which the flames
crackled and floated off in the open fireplace.</p>

<p>The captain had come into the kitchen, and
stood surveying the field of battle with a sort of
pleasure. There were many kinds of agreeable prospects
here for the thoughts to dwell upon, and
samples of the finished products were continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
being sent up to the office for him to give his opinion
on.</p>

<p>"I'll show you how you should chop, girls," he
said sportively, and took the knives from Torbj&#246;rg.</p>

<p>The two chopping-knives in his hands went up
and down in the chopping-tray so furiously that
they could hardly be distinguished, and awakened
unmistakable admiration in the whole kitchen, while
all paused in bewilderment at the masterpiece.</p>

<p>It is true, it continued for only two or three minutes,
while Torbj&#246;rg and Aslak must stand with
linen towels on their heads and chop all day.</p>

<p>But victory is still victory, and when the captain
afterwards went into the sitting-room, humming
contentedly, it was not without a little amused recollection
of his strategy,&mdash;for, "yes, upon my soul,"
he could feel that his arms ached afterwards, nevertheless.
And he rubbed them two or three times
before he tied a napkin around his neck and seated
himself at the table in order to do justice to the
warm blood-pudding, with raisins and butter on it,
which Thinka brought in to him.</p>

<p>"A little mustard, Thinka."</p>

<p>Thinka's quiet figure glided to the corner cupboard
after the desired article.</p>

<p>"The plate might have been warmer for this
kind of thing&mdash;it really ought to be almost burning
hot for the raisins and butter."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>The always handy Thinka was out by the chimney
in a moment with a plate. She came in again
with it in a napkin; it could not be held in any other
way.</p>

<p>"Just pour it all over on to this plate, father, and
then you will see."</p>

<p>One of the happy domestic traits which Thinka
had disclosed since her return home was a wonderful
knack of managing her father; there was hardly any
trace of peevishness any longer.</p>

<p>Thinka's quiet, agreeable pliancy and cool, even
poise spread comfort in the house. The captain
knew that he only needed to put her on the track
of some good idea or other in the way of food, and
something always came of it. She was so handy,
while, when Ma yielded, it was always done so
clumsily and with difficulty, just as if she creaked
on being moved, so to speak, that he became fretful,
and began to dispute in spite of it, notwithstanding
she knew very well he could not bear it.</p>

<p>A very great deal had been done since Monday
morning, and to-morrow evening it was to be hoped
they would be ready. Two cows, a heifer, and a hog,
that was no little slaughtering&mdash;besides the sheep
carcasses.</p>

<p>"The sheriff&mdash;the sheriff's horse is in the yard,"
was suddenly reported in the twilight into the bustle
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>The sheriff! It was lightning that struck.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurry up to the office and get your father
down to receive him, J&#246;rgen," said Ma, composing
herself. "You will have to take off the towels
and then stop pounding, Great-Ola, exasperating as
it is."</p>

<p>"They smell it when the pudding smokes in the
kettle, I think," exclaimed Marit, in her lively
mountain dialect. "Isn't it the second year he has
come here just at the time of the Christmas slaughtering?
So they are rid of the menfolk lying in the
way at home among themselves."</p>

<p>"Your tongue wags, Marit," said Ma, reprovingly.
"The sheriff certainly does not find it any
too pleasant at home since he lost his wife, poor
man."</p>

<p>But it was dreadfully unfortunate that he came
just now&mdash;excessively unfortunate. She must keep
her ground; it wouldn't do to stop things out here
now. The captain came hastily out into the kitchen.
"The sheriff will stay here till to-morrow&mdash;it can't
be helped, Ma. I will take care of him, if we only
get a little something to eat."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is easy to say, J&#228;ger&mdash;just as all of
us have our hands full."</p>

<p>"Some minced meat&mdash;fried meat-balls&mdash;a little
blood-pudding. That is easy enough. I told him
that he would have slaughter-time fare&mdash;and then,
Thinka," he nodded to her, "a little toddy as soon
as possible."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>Thinka had already started; she only stopped a
moment at her bureau upstairs.</p>

<p>She was naturally so unassuming, and was not
accustomed to feel embarrassed. Therefore she
brought in the toddy tray like the wind, stopping
only to put a clean blue apron on; and, after having
spoken to the sheriff, went to the cupboard after
rum and arrack, and to the tobacco table after some
lighters, which she put down by the tray for the
gentlemen before she vanished out through the
kitchen door again.</p>

<p>"You must wash your hands, Torbj&#246;rg, and
put things to rights in the guest-chamber; and then
we must send a messenger for Anne Vaelta to help
us, little as she is fit for. J&#246;rgen, hurry!" came from
Ma, who saw herself more and more deprived of
her most needed forces.</p>

<p>Great-Ola had put up the sheriff's horse, and
now stood pounding again at the mortar in his white
surplice&mdash;thump, thump, thump, thump.</p>

<p>"Are you out of your senses out here? Don't
you think?" said the captain, bouncing in; he spoke
in a low voice, but for that reason the more passionately.
"Aren't you going to mangle, too? Then
the sheriff would get a thundering with a vengeance,
both over his head and under his feet. It shakes the
floor."</p>

<p>A look of despair came over Ma's face; in the
sudden, dark, wild glance of her eye there almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
shone rebellion&mdash;now he was beginning to drive
her too far&mdash;But it ended in a resigned, "You can
take the mortar with you out on the stone floor of
the porch, Great-Ola."</p>

<p>And Thinka had to attend to the work of putting
things in order and carrying in the supper, so
that it was only necessary for Ma to sit there a little
while, as they were eating, though she was on pins
and needles, it is true; but she must act as if there
was nothing the matter.</p>

<p>When Ma came in, there was a little formal talk
in the beginning between her and the sheriff about
the heavy loss he had suffered. She had not met
him since he lost his wife, three months ago. It was
lonesome for him now that he had only his sister,
Miss G&#252;lcke, with him. Both Viggo and Baldrian,
which was a short name for Baltazar, were at the
Latin school, and would not come home again till
next year, when Viggo would enter the university.</p>

<p>The sheriff winked a little, and made a mournful
gesture as if he wanted to convey an idea of
sadly wiping one eyelash, but no more. He had
given an exhibition of grief within nearly every
threshold in the district by this time, and here he
was in the house of people of too much common
sense not to excuse him from any more protracted
outburst just before a spread table with hot plates.</p>

<p>It developed into a rather long session at the
table&mdash;with ever stronger compliments, as often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
as there was opportunity during the meal-time to
catch a glimpse of the hostess, for every new dish
that Thinka brought in smoking deliciously straight
from the pan&mdash;actually a slaughtering feast&mdash;with
a fine bottle of old ale in addition&mdash;for the new
Christmas brew was too fresh as yet&mdash;and two or
three good drams brought in just at the right time.</p>

<p>The sheriff also understood very well what was
going on in the house, and how the hostess and
Thinka were managing it.</p>

<p>The grown-up daughter cleared off the table and
took care of everything so handily and comfortably
without any bother and fuss&mdash;and so considerately.
They had their pipes and a glass of toddy
by their side again there on the sofa, with a fresh
steaming pitcher, before they were aware of it.</p>

<p>The small inquisitive eyes of Sheriff G&#252;lcke
stood far apart; they looked into two corners at
once, while his round, bald head shone on the one
he talked to. He sat looking at the blond, rather
slender young lady, with the delicate, light complexion,
who busied herself so silently and gracefully.</p>

<p>"You are a fortunate man, you are, Captain,"
he said, speaking into the air.</p>

<p>"Have a little taste, Sheriff," said the captain
consolingly, and they touched glasses.</p>

<p>"Nay, you who have a house full of comfort
can talk&mdash;cushions about you in every corner&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
you can export to the city&mdash;But I, you see,"&mdash;his
eyes became moist&mdash;"sit there in my office
over the records. I was very much coddled, you
know&mdash;oh, well, don't let us talk about it. I must
have my punishment for one thing and another,
I suppose, as well as others.</p>

<p>"Isn't it true, Miss Kathinka," he asked when
she came in, "it is a bad sheriff who wholly unbidden
falls straight down upon you in slaughtering-time?
But you must lend him a little home
comfort, since it is all over with such things at his
own home.</p>

<p>"Bless me, I had almost forgotten it," he exclaimed
eagerly, and hastened, with his pipe in his
mouth, to his document case, which hung on a
chair near the door. "I have the second volume
of <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> for you from Bine
Scharfenberg, and was to get&mdash;nay, what was it?
It is on a memorandum&mdash;<i>A Capricious Woman</i>,
by Emilie Carl&#233;n."</p>

<p>He took it out eagerly and handed it over to
her, not without a certain gallantry.</p>

<p>"Now you must not forget to give it to me to-morrow
morning, Miss Kathinka," he said threateningly,
"or else you will make me very unhappy
down at Bine Scharfenberg's. It won't do to offend
her, you know."</p>

<p>Even while the sheriff was speaking, Thinka's
eye glided eagerly over the first lines&mdash;only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
make sure about the continuation&mdash;and in a twinkling
she was down again from her room with the
read-through book by Carl&#233;n and the first volume
of the Mohicans done up in paper and tied with
a bit of thread.</p>

<p>"You are as prompt as a man of business, Miss
Thinka," he said jokingly, as with a sort of slow
carefulness he put the package into his case; his
two small eyes shone tenderly upon her.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding there had been slaughtering
and hubbub ever since early in the morning,
Thinka must still, after she had gone to bed, allow
herself to peep a little in the entertaining book.</p>

<p>It was one chapter, and one more, and still one
more, with ever weakening determination to end
with the next.</p>

<p>Still at two o'clock in the morning she lay with her
candlestick behind her on the pillow, and steadily
read <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, with all the vicissitudes
of the pursuits and dangers of the noble Uncas.</p>

<p>Ma wondered, it is true, that so many of the
slender tallow candles were needed this winter.</p>

<p>The sheriff must have a little warm breakfast
before going away in the morning.</p>

<p>And now he took leave, and thanked them for
the hours that had been so agreeable and cheering,
although he came so inconveniently&mdash;oh, madame,
he knew he came at an inconvenient time. "Although
now you have certainly got a right hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
in household matters. Yes, Miss Thinka, I have
tested you; one does not have the eye of a policeman
for nothing.</p>

<p>"Invisible, and yet always at hand, like a quiet
spirit in the house&mdash;is not that the best that can
be said of a woman?" he asked, complimenting her
fervently, when he had got his scarf around his
fur coat, and went down to the sleigh with beaming
eyes and a little grayish stubble of beard&mdash;for
he had not shaved himself to-day.</p>

<p>"Pleasant man, the sheriff. His heart is in the
right place," said the captain when, enlivened and
rubbing his hands from the cold, he came in again
into the sitting-room.</p>

<p class="p3t">But father became ill after all the rich food at the
slaughtering-time.</p>

<p>The army doctor advised him to drink water
and exercise a good deal; a toddy spree now and
then would not do him any harm.</p>

<p>And it did not improve the rush of blood to his
head that Christmas came so soon after.</p>

<p>Father was depressed, but was reluctant to be
bled, except the customary twice a year, in the
spring and autumn.</p>

<p>After the little party for Buchholtz, the judge's
chief clerk, on Thursday, he was much worse. He
went about unhappy, and saw loss and neglect and
erroneous reckonings in all quarters.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>There was no help for it, a messenger must go
now after the parish clerk, &#214;jseth.</p>

<p>Besides his clerical duties, he taught the youth,
vaccinated, and let blood.</p>

<p>What he was good for in the first named direction
shall be left unsaid; but in the last it could
safely be said that he had very much, nay, barrels,
of the blood of the district on his conscience, and
not least that of the full-blooded captain, whom
he had bled regularly now for a series of years.</p>

<p>The effect was magnificent. After the sultry and
oppressive stormy and pessimistic mood, which
filled, so to speak, every groove in the house and
oppressed all faces, even down to Pasop&mdash;a brilliant
fair weather, jokes with Thinka, and wild plans
that the family should go down in the summer and
see the manoeuvres.</p>

<p>It was at the point of complete good humor that
Ma resolutely seized the opportunity to speak
about J&#246;rgen's going to school&mdash;all that Aunt
Alette had offered of board and lodging, and what
she thought could be managed otherwise.</p>

<p>There was a reckoning and studying, with demonstration
and counter-demonstration, down to
the finest details of the cost of existence in the city.</p>

<p>The captain represented the items of expenditure
and the debit side in the form of indignant
questions and conjectures for every single one, as
to whether she wanted to ruin him, and Ma stubbornly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and persistently defended the credit side,
while she went over and went over again all the
items to be deducted.</p>

<p>When, time after time, things whirled round and
round in the continual repetition, so that she got
confused, there were bad hours before she succeeded
in righting herself in the storm.</p>

<p>The captain must be accustomed to it slowly,
until it penetrated so far into him that he began
to see and think. But, like a persistent, untiring
cruiser, she always had the goal before her eyes
and drew near to it imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"This ready money"&mdash;it was for Ma to touch
a sore, which nevertheless must be opened. The
result was that the captain allowed himself to be
convinced, and now became himself the most zealous
for the plan.</p>

<p>J&#246;rgen was examined in all directions. He was
obliged to sit in the office, and the captain subjected
him to the cramming process.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"That's as old as the hills," read the captain.
"If you swing a hen round and put her down backwards
with a chalk mark in front of her beak, she
will lie perfectly still; will not dare to move. She certainly
believes it is a string that holds her. I have
tried it ever so many times&mdash;that you may safely
tell her, Thinka."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>"But why does Inger-Johanna write that?"
asked Ma, rather seriously.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh,&mdash;for nothing&mdash;only so&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thinka had yesterday received her own letter,
enclosed in that to her parents; it was a letter in
regard to Ma's approaching birthday, which was
under discussion between the sisters. And Inger-Johanna
had given her a lecture in it, something
almost inciting her to rebellion and to stick to her
flame there in the west, if there really was any fire
in it. That about the hen and the chalk mark was
something at second-hand from Grip. Women
could be made to believe everything possible, and
gladly suffered death when they got such a chalk
mark before their beaks!</p>

<p>That might be true enough, Thinka thought.
But now, when all were so against it, and she saw
how it would distress her father and mother, then&mdash;she
sighed and had a lump in her throat&mdash;the
chalk mark was really thicker than she could manage,
nevertheless.</p>

<p>Inger-Johanna's letter had made her very heavy
hearted. She felt so unhappy that she could have
cried, if any one only looked at her; and as Ma did
that several times during the day, she probably
went about a little red-eyed.</p>

<p>At night she read <i>Arwed Gyllenstjerna</i>, by Van
der Velde, so that the bitter tears flowed.</p>

<p>Her sister's letter also contained something on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
her own account, which was not meant for her father
and mother.</p>

<p class="p3t">For you see, Thinka, when you have gone through
balls here as I have, you do not any longer skip
about blindly with all the lights in your eyes. You
know a little by yourself; one way or another, there
ought to be something in the manner of the person.
Oh, this ball chat! I say, as Grip does: I am
tired, tired, tired of it. Aunt isn't any longer so
eager that I shall be there, though many times
more eager than I.</p>

<p>There I am now looked upon as haughty and
critical and whatever else it is, only because I will
not continually find something to talk away about!
Aunt now thinks that I have got a certain coldness
of my own in my "too lively nature," a reserved
calm, which is imposing and piquant&mdash;that is what
she wants, I suppose! In all probability just like the
ice in the steaming hot pudding among the Chinese,
which we read about, you remember, in the <i>Bee</i>.</p>

<p>Aunt has so many whims this winter. Now we
two must talk nothing but French together! But
that she should write to Captain R&#246;nnow that I
was so perfect in it, I did not like at all; I have no
desire to figure as a school-girl before him when he
returns; neither is my pronunciation so "sweet,"
as she says!</p>

<p>I really don't understand her any longer. If there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
was any one who could and ought to defend Grip
at this time, it should be she; but instead of that,
she attacks him whenever she can.</p>

<p>He has begun to keep a free Sunday-school or
lecture for those who choose to come, in a hall out
on Storgaden. It is something, you know, which
creates a sensation. And aunt shrugs her shoulders,
and looks forward to the time when he will vanish
out of good society, although she has always been
the first to interest herself in him and to say that
he came with something new. It is extremely mean
of her, I think.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter VIII</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">J&#246;rgen</span> must start on his journey before the
sleighing disappeared, for the bad roads when
the frost was coming out might last till St. John's
Day, and to harness the horses in such going would
be stark madness. If he were not to lose a whole
year, he must go early and be prepared privately
for admission to school.</p>

<p>J&#246;rgen was lost in meditations and thoughts
about all that from which he was about to be separated.
The gun, the sleds, the skis, the turning-lathe,
the tools, the wind-mill, and the corn-mill
left behind there on the hills, all must be devised
with discretion&mdash;naturally to Thea first and foremost,
on condition that she should take care of
them till he came home again.</p>

<p>If he had been asked what he would rather
be, he would doubtless have answered "turner,"
"miller," or "smith;" the last thing in the world
which would have presented itself to his range of
ideas, to say nothing of coming up as a bent or
a longing, would have been the lifting up to the
loftier regions of books. But Greece and Latium
were lying like an unalterable fate across his path,
so that there was nothing to do or even to think
about.</p>

<p>On the day of his departure, the pockets of his
new clothes, which were made out of the captain's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
old ones, were a complete depository for secret despatches.</p>

<p>First, a long letter of fourteen pages, written
in the night, blotted with tears, from Thinka to Inger-Johanna,
in which with full details she gave
the origin, continuation, and hopeless development
of her love for Aas. She had three keepsakes from
him&mdash;a little breastpin, the cologne bottle which
he had given her on the Christmas tree, and then
his letter to her with a lock of his hair on the
morning he had to leave the office. And even if she
could not now act against the wishes of her parents,
but would rather make herself unhappy, still she had
promised herself faithfully never to forget him, to
think of him till the last hour.</p>

<p>The second despatch was from Ma to Aunt
Alette, and contained&mdash;besides some economical
propositions&mdash;a little suggestion about sounding
Inger-Johanna when Captain R&#246;nnow returned
from Paris. Ma could not quite understand her this
last time.</p>

<p class="p3t">The captain had never imagined that there would
be such a vacuum after J&#246;rgen was gone. In his
way he had been the occasion of so much mental
excitement, so many exertions and anxieties, and
so much heightened furious circulation of blood,
that now he was away the captain had lost quite a
stimulating influence. He had now no longer any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
one to look after and supervise with eyes in the
back of his head, to exercise his acuteness on, or
take by surprise&mdash;only the quiet, unassailable Thea
to keep school with.</p>

<p>The doctor prescribed a blood-purifying dandelion
tonic for him.</p>

<p>And now when the spring came&mdash;dazzling light,
gleaming water everywhere, with melting patches
of snow and its vanguards of red stone broken on
the steep mountain sides&mdash;Thinka, with a case-knife
in her numb hands, was out in the meadow
gathering dandelion roots. They were small, young,
and still tender, but they were becoming stronger
day by day.</p>

<p>The captain, with military punctuality, at seven
o'clock every morning emptied the cup prepared
for him and stormed out.</p>

<p>To-day a fierce, boisterous, icy cold blast of rain
with hail and snow met him at the outer door and
blew far in on the floor. The sides of the mountains
were white again.</p>

<p>These last mornings he was accustomed to run
down over the newly broken-up potato field, which
was being ploughed; but in this weather&mdash;</p>

<p>"We must give up the field work, Ola," he
announced as his resolution in the yard&mdash;"it looks
as if the nags would rather have to go out with the
snow-plough."</p>

<p>He trudged away; it was not weather to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
still in. The rain drove and pounded in showers
down over the windows in the sitting-room with
great ponds of water, so that it must be continually
mopped up and cloths placed on the window-seats.</p>

<p>Ma and Thinka stood there in the gray daylight
over the fruit of their common work at the loom
this winter&mdash;a roller with still unbleached linen,
which they measured out into tablecloths and napkins.</p>

<p>The door opened wide, and the captain's stout
form appeared, enveloped in a dripping overcoat.</p>

<p>"I met a stranger down here with something
for you, Thinka&mdash;wrapped up in oil-cloth. Can
you guess whom it is from?"</p>

<p>Thinka dropped the linen, and blushing red advanced
a step towards him, but immediately shook
her head.</p>

<p>"Rejerstad, that execution-horse, had it with him
on his trip up. He was to leave it here." The captain
stood inspecting the package. "The sheriff's
seal&mdash;Bring me the scissors."</p>

<p>In his officiousness, he did not give himself time
to take his coat off.</p>

<p>"A para-sol!&mdash;A beautiful&mdash;new&mdash;" Thinka
burst out. She remained standing and gazing at it.</p>

<p>"See the old&mdash;Hanged if the sheriff isn't making
up to you, Thinka."</p>

<p>"Don't you see that here is 'philopena' on the
seal, J&#228;ger?" Ma put in, to afford a cover.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>"I won a philopena from him&mdash;on New Year's
Day, when father and I took dinner at Pastor Horn's&mdash;after
church. I had entirely forgotten it," she
said in a husky tone. Her eyes glanced from the
floor halfway up to her parents, as she quietly
went out, leaving the parasol lying on the table.</p>

<p>"I guess you will use your linen for a wedding
outfit, Ma," said the captain, slapping his hands and
swinging his hat with a flourish. "What would you
say to the sheriff for a son-in-law here at Gilje?"</p>

<p>"You saw that Thinka went out, J&#228;ger." Ma's
voice trembled a little. "Very likely she is thinking
that it is not long since his wife was laid in the
grave. Thinka is very good, and would like to submit
to us; but there may be limits to what we can
ask." There was something precipitate in her movements
over the linen, which indicated internal disturbance.</p>

<p>"The sheriff, Ma; is not he a catch? Fine, handsome
man in his best years. Faith, I don't know
what you women will have. And, Gitta," he reminded
her, a little moved, "it is just the men who have
lived most happily in their first marriage who marry
again the soonest."</p>

<p>Time flew with tearing haste towards St. John's
Day. Spring was brewing in the air and over the
lakes. The meadow stood moist and damp, hillock
on hillock, like the luxuriant forelocks of horses.
The swollen brooks sighed and roared with freshly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
shining banks. They boiled over, as it were, with
the power of the same generating life and sap that
made the buds burst in alder, willow, and birch almost
audibly, and shows its nature in the bouncing,
vigorous movements of the mountain boy, in
his rapid speech, his lively, shining eyes, and his
elastic walk.</p>

<p>At the beginning of summer a letter came from
Inger-Johanna, the contents of which set the captain's
thoughts into a new flight:</p>


<p class="sigright p3t"><i>June 14, 1843</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Parents</span>,&mdash;At last a little breath to write
to you. Captain R&#246;nnow went away yesterday, and
I have as yet hardly recovered my balance from
the two or three weeks of uninterrupted sociability
while he was here.</p>

<p>It will be pleasant to get out to Tilder&#246;d next
week on top of all this. It is beginning to be hot
and oppressive here in the city.</p>

<p>There did not pass a day that we were not at
a party, either at dinner or in the evening; but the
pearl of them was aunt's own little dinners, which
she has a reputation for, and at which we spoke
only French. The conversation ran on so easily, one
expresses one's self so differently, and our thoughts
capture each other's already half guessed. R&#246;nnow
certainly speaks French brilliantly.</p>

<p>A man who carries himself as he does makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
certain noble, masterly impression; you are transported
into an atmosphere of chivalric manly dignity,
and hear the spurs jingle, I had almost said
musically; you almost forget that there are those
who stamp their feet.</p>

<p>When I compare the awkward compliments at
balls, which may come smack in your face, with
Captain R&#246;nnow's manner of saying and not saying
and yet getting a thing in, then I do not deny
that I get the feeling of a kind of exhilarating pleasure.
He claimed that he had such an illusion from
sitting opposite me at the table. I resembled so
much a portrait of a historic lady which he had seen
at the Louvre; naturally she had black hair and
carried her neck haughtily and looked before her,
smiling, with an expression which might have been
characterized, "I wait&mdash;and reject&mdash;till he comes,
who can put me in my right place."</p>

<p>Well, if it amuses him to think of such things,
then I am happy to receive the compliments. It is
true there are such godfathers and uncles who are
utterly infatuated with their goddaughters, and spoil
them with nonsense and sweets. I am afraid that
R&#246;nnow is a little inclined to this so far as I am
concerned, for, sensible and straightforward as he
always is, he continually launches out into superlatives
in relation to me; and I really cannot help
thinking that it is both flattering and pleasant when
he is continually saying that I am made for presiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
where ladies and gentlemen of the higher
circles are received. He really must think more
of me than I deserve, because he sees that I am
perhaps a little more open and direct than others,
and have no natural gift at concealing what I mean,
when I am in society.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, that is the thanks you get because you
have continually spoiled me; in any case, I do not
immediately creep under a chair, but try to sit where
I am sitting as long as possible.</p>

<p>But, now, why hasn't such a man married? If
he had been younger, and I just a little vainer, he
might almost have been dangerous. He still has fine
black hair&mdash;a little thin, and perhaps he takes a
little too much pains with it. There is one thing I
cannot understand, and that is why people try to
conceal their age.</p>

<p class="p3t">The captain gave a poke at his wig: "When one
goes a-courting, Ma," he said, smiling.</p>

<p class="p3t">Two mail days later he came home from the post-office
with a long letter from Aunt Alette to Ma.
She was not a favorite of his. In the first place she
was too "well read and cultured;" in the second
place she was "sweet;" lastly, she was an old maid.</p>

<p>He seated himself in an armchair, with his arms
folded before him, to have it read to him. He plainly
regarded it as a bitter document.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p class="p3t"><span class="smcap">My dear Gitta</span>,&mdash;It is no easy task, but really a
rather complicated and difficult one, you have laid
upon the shoulders of an old maid, even if she is
your never failing, faithful Aunt Alette. If we could
only have talked together, you would have soon
guessed my meaning; but now there is no other way
for me to free my conscience than to write and write,
till it has all come out that I have on my mind.</p>

<p>Now you know well enough that the governor's
wife is not in my line, and if it had not been for
what you wrote me when you sent Inger-Johanna
here, I certainly should not have moved my old
limbs so far out of the old town where I have my
circle of firm friends, and gone in to make formal
calls at the governor's, notwithstanding she is always
excessively friendly and means it, too, I dare
say.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I must tell you that Inger-Johanna
is a lady in every respect, but still with
more substance to her, if I may express myself so, and
stronger will than our poor Eleonore. It is certain
that she in many ways overawes, not to say domineers
over, your sister-in-law, strict and domineering
as she otherwise has the reputation of being.
And, therefore, she must resort to underhand means
in many things, when she finds that it won't do to
play the game openly before Inger-Johanna, which,
according to my best convictions, has been the case
with regard to the captain. He certainly came here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
this time from his trip to Paris with the full intent
of completing his courting, after, like a wise and
prudent general, having first surveyed the ground
with his own eyes. Simply the manner in which he
always addressed and paid his respects to her would
have convinced a blind person of that.</p>

<p>The only one, however, who does not understand
it, notwithstanding she is besieged in a thousand
ways, is the object of his attentions herself.
She sits there in the midst of the incense, truly protected
against the shrewdness of the whole world by
her natural innocence, which is doubly surprising,
and, old Aunt Alette says, to be admired in her who
is so remarkably clever.</p>

<p>I will not, indeed, absolve her from being a little
giddy at all the incense which he and your sister-in-law
incessantly burn before her (and what elderly,
experienced person would not tolerate and forgive
this in a young girl!) But the giddiness does not
tend to the desired result, namely, the falling in
love, but only makes her a little puffed up in her
feeling of being a perfect lady, and is limited to
her doing homage to him as the knightly cavalier
and&mdash;her father's highly honored friend.</p>

<p>It is this, which he, so to speak, is for the
present beaten back by, so he is going abroad again,
and this evidently after consultation with your sister-in-law.
Inger-Johanna, if my old eyes do not deceive
me,&mdash;and something we two have seen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
experienced, both separately and together, in this
world, dear Gitta,&mdash;is not found ready for the matrimonial
question, inasmuch as her vanity and pride
have hitherto appeared as a feeling entirely isolated
from this.</p>

<p class="p3t">There was a snore from the leather-covered chair,
and Ma continued, more softly:</p>

<p class="p3t">She may, indeed, and that tolerably earnestly,
wish to rule over a fine salon; but she has not yet
been brought clearly to comprehend that with it she
must take the man who owns it. There is something
in her open nature which always keeps the
distance between these two questions too wide for
even a captain of cavalry to leap over it. God bless
her!</p>

<p>Love is like an awakening, without which we
neither know nor understand anything of its holy
language; and unhappy are they who learn to know
it too late, when they have imprisoned themselves
in the so-called bonds of duty. I am almost absolutely
sure that love has not yet been awakened in
Inger-Johanna&mdash;may a good angel protect her!</p>

<p class="p3t">"Ouf!&mdash;such old maids," said the captain, waking
up. "Go on, go on&mdash;is there any more?"</p>

<p class="p3t">How far the young student who has a position in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the office is in any degree a hindrance to these plans,
I don't dare to say, either pro or con. But the
governor's wife thinks or fears something, I am
firmly convinced from her whole manner of treating
him lately, although she is far too bright to let Inger-Johanna
get even the slightest suspicion of her real
reason.</p>

<p>I heard it plainly when I took coffee there on
Sunday, before they went away to Tilder&#246;d, and
she had the maid tell him that she could not see
him. There was a not very gracious allusion to his
"Sunday professorship of pettifogging ideas," as
she called it.</p>

<p>I suppose these must be something of the same
sort of ideas that I was enthusiastic about when I
was young and read Rousseau's <i>&#201;mile</i>, which absorbed
me very much, nay, which can yet occupy
some of my thoughts. For she stated, as one of his
leading ideas, that he, in his headlong blindness,
thought that he could simplify the world, and first
and foremost education, to a very few natural propositions
or so-called principles. And you know, we&mdash;still,
that is going to be quite too long. To be
brief, when Inger-Johanna with impetuosity rushed
to the defence of Grip, she saw in him only the son
of the idiotic "cadet at Lurleiken," as he is called,
one of the well-known, amusing figures of the country;
but this one, in addition to his father's distracted
ideas, was also equipped with a faculty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
using that fearful weapon, satire&mdash;<i>voil&#224;</i> the phantom
Grip!</p>

<p>Youthful student ideas could perhaps be used
gracefully enough as piquant topics of conversation;
but instead of that, to set them in motion in a headlong
and sensational manner, without regard to the
opinion of older people, was a great step, was pretentious,
and showed something immature, something
raw, which by no means ought to be relished.</p>

<p>I have reported this so much at length in order
to show you by the very expressions that there may
be here a "good deal of cotton in the linen," as the
saying is.</p>

<p>And since I am going to bring my innermost
heart to light, I shall have to tell you that he appears
to me to be a trustworthy, truthful young man,
whose natural disposition is as he speaks and not
otherwise, and he carries a beautiful stamp on his
countenance and in his whole bearing. If possibly
he is a little forgetful of "My son, if you want to
get on in the world, then bow," that is worst for
him and not to his dishonor, we know.</p>

<p>It was also a truly refreshing enjoyment for me,
as if looking into the kingdom of youth, awakening
many thoughts, to talk with him, the two evenings
this winter when he accompanied me, an old woman,
home from the governor's (for him, I have no doubt,
a very small pleasure), all the way out to the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
town, when otherwise I should have been obliged
to go anxiously with my servant-girl and a lantern.</p>

<p class="p3t">"Bah! nobody will attack her," growled the captain,
bored.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter IX</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> captain had had a genuine drive in the
service ever since summer, when he and the
lieutenant inspected the storehouse for the tents,
together with the arsenal and the guns in the levying
districts. Then the military exercises, and finally
now the meeting of the commissioners of conscription.
There had been tolerably lively goings-on at
the inn in the principal parish the last two or three
evenings with the army doctor, the solicitor Sebelow,
tall Buchholtz, Dorff the sheriff's officer, and
the lieutenants.</p>

<p>But the result was splendid in so far that, instead
of the bay horse, he was now driving home with
a fine three or four-year-old before the cariole, with
a white star on the forehead and white stockings
that almost promised to be a match for Svarten if&mdash;if&mdash;it
were not a bolter.</p>

<p>It had just now, when the old beggar woman rose
up from the ditch by the wayside, shown something
in the eyes and ears which it certainly had concealed
during all the three days of the session. He had at
last even shot over its head to test it, without so
much as the horse giving a start.</p>

<p>It would be too mean, after the doctor and First
Lieutenant Dunsack had been unanimous in the
same opinion as he about the beast, and he, besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
had given the horse-dealer twenty-five dollars to
boot.</p>

<p>But now it trotted off with the cariole very steadily
and finely. The little inclination to break into a
canter was only unmannerliness and a little of coltish
bad habits which stuck to it still, and would
disappear by driving.</p>

<p>Great-Ola had not had a steadier horse in the stall
by the side of Svarten, nevertheless&mdash;"You shall
grow old in my barn; do you understand, you
young Svarten? shall go to the city in pairs with
your uncle&mdash;before the carriage for Inger&mdash;There
now, you beast&mdash;of a&mdash;dog"&mdash;swip&mdash;swish&mdash;swip&mdash;swish&mdash;"I
shall teach you to drop your
bad habits, I shall. Whoa!" he thundered. "There!
there!"</p>

<p>There was a whole train of gay fellows who were
standing, talking, shouting, and drinking in the road
outside the gate to the Bergset farm.</p>

<p>At the sight of the captain's well-known form
they made way for him, greeting him politely. They
knew that he had been far away, and the men who
had gone to the mustering had just returned to the
farms round about, yesterday and to-day.</p>

<p>"Fine, isn't he, Halvor Hejen? a lively colt&mdash;still,
rather young."</p>

<p>"Maybe, captain. Fine, if he isn't skittish," replied
the one spoken to.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>"What is going on here&mdash;auction after Ole Bergset?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Bardon, the bailiff, is busy with the hammer
in the room in there."</p>

<p>"So, so, Solfest Staale!" he said, winking to
a young man, "do you believe there is anything
in the story that Lars &#214;verstadsbraekken is courting
the widow here? Their lands lie very fine."</p>

<p>There came an ill-concealed amusement on the
countenances of those standing about. They guessed
what the captain was at. It was the rival he was
speaking to.</p>

<p>"There is not any cow for sale that is going to
calve in the fall, I suppose?"</p>

<p>There might be, they thought.</p>

<p>"Hold my horse a little while, Halvor, while I
go and talk a little with the bailiff about it."</p>

<p>There was a crowd of people in the house and the
captain was greeted by one knot after another of
noisy talking folk, men and women, girls and boys,
among whom the brandy bottle was diligently circulating,
until he got into the room where the sale
was going on.</p>

<p>There sat Bardon in the crowded, steaming room,
calling over and over again, with his well-known,
strong, husky voice, threatening with the hammer,
giving utterance to a joke, finally threatening
for the last, last time, until with the law's blows
he nailed the bid firmly forever down on the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
of the table. They made way for the captain as he
came.</p>

<p>"Are you also so crazy as to allow your wife to
go to the auction, Martin Kvale?" he said, joking,
to an important fellow with silver buttons on his
coat, as he passed by.</p>

<p>Out in the hall stood the handsome Guro Granlien
with a crowd of other young girls.</p>

<p>"Oh, Guro!" he said, chucking her under the
chin, "now Bersvend Vaage has come home from
the drill. He was in a brown study and wholly lost
his wits, the fellow, and so I came near putting him
in arrest: you are too hard on him, Guro." He
nodded to the snickering girls.</p>

<p>Guro looked with great, staring eyes at the captain.
How could he know that?</p>

<p>The captain knew the district in and out, forwards
and backwards, as he expressed it. He had
an inconceivably keen scent for contemplated farm
trades, weddings, betrothals, and anything of the
kind that concerned the young conscripts. Guro
Granlien was not the first girl who opened her eyes
wide on that account. He got a great deal out of his
five subalterns, but by no means the least was to
be found in his own always alert interest in these
things.</p>

<p>And when, to-day, he made the little turn up
to the place of auction, the reason was far less the
"autumn cow," than his lively curiosity for the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
things that might have happened during his long
absence.</p>

<p>Therefore it was not at all unwelcome to him
when the widow came out and invited him into the
"other room," where he must at least have a drop
of ale before he left the farm.</p>

<p>He was curious to get her on the confessional as
to the possibility of a new marriage, and also had
the satisfaction, after a half hour's confidential chat,
of having won from her confidence the whole of
the real and true condition of her thoughts about
herself and the farm.</p>

<p>No one cheated him any longer about that affair,&mdash;the
widow of Bergset was to retain undivided
possession of the estate of the deceased and&mdash;not
marry. But she was anxious not to let it come out;
she wanted to be courted, of course&mdash;as a good
match in the district, naturally.</p>

<p>The captain understood it very well: it was sly.</p>

<p>Something must also be said about something
else at last, and so Randi, in the spirit of what had
been said, added: "And the sheriff, who is going to
marry again."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"They say he is a constant visitor at the house
of Scharfenberg, the solicitor. Very likely it is the
youngest daughter, eh?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. Good-by, Randi."</p>

<p>He went quickly, so that his spurs rattled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
his sabre flapped under his coat, down to his horse
without looking to the right or left or speaking to
any one. He pressed his shako more firmly down
on his forehead before he got into the cariole.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Halvor. Give me the reins. There
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He gave young Svarten, who began with some
capers, a taste of the whip, and off he went with
tight reins at full trot, so that the fence-posts flew
like drumsticks past his eyes.</p>

<p>In the quiet, hazy autumn day the cattle here
and there were out on the highway.</p>

<p>A pig provoked him by obstinately running before
the cariole.</p>

<p>"There, take care to get your stumps out of the
way!"</p>

<p>It ended with a little cut on its back.</p>

<p>"See there! there is a beast of a cow lying in the
middle of the road," he broke out, with his lips
firmly pressed together.</p>

<p>"Well, if you won't get up, then you are welcome
to stay! If you please&mdash;I am stupid also&mdash;I'll
drive on."</p>

<p>His bitterness took full possession of him, and
he would have firmly allowed the wheel to go over
the animal's back if the latter had not risen up
quickly at the last moment, so near that the captain's
cariole was half raised up, while it grazed and
was within an ace of being upset.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"Hm, hm," he mumbled, somewhat brought
to his senses as he looked back upon the object of
his missed revenge.</p>

<p>"So, so&mdash;off, I say, you black knacker&mdash;if you
once peep back again in that way, I will kill you! Ha,
ha, ha! If you run, you will still find a hill, my good
friend."</p>

<p>He had had a tremendous headache all day;
but it was not that which annoyed him&mdash;that he
knew.</p>

<p>And when he came home, where they were expecting
father to-day in great suspense after his long
absence, his looks were dark.</p>

<p>"There, Ola! Curry the horse&mdash;dry him with a
wisp of straw first&mdash;take good care of him&mdash;put a
blanket on his back; do you hear? I only drove the
fellow a little up the hill."</p>

<p>Great-Ola looked at the captain and nodded his
head confidently, as he led the horse and carriage
away from the steps; there was surely something
the matter; the captain had got cheated again with
this new nag.</p>

<p>"Good day, Ma&mdash;good day!" and he kissed her
hastily. "Yes, I am quite well."</p>

<p>He took off his cloak and shako. "Oh, can't you
let Marit take the trunk and the travelling-bag so
that they needn't stand there on the steps any
longer?&mdash;Oh, yes; it has been tiresome enough,"
as he evaded rather coldly Thinka's attentions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
"Put the sabre on the peg, and carry the bag up to
my chamber."</p>

<p>He himself went first up to the office to look at
the mail, and then down to the stable to see how
Great-Ola had treated Svarten.</p>

<p>There was something the matter with father; that
was clear!</p>

<p>Ma's face, anxiously disturbed, followed him here
and there in the doorways, and Thinka glided in
and out without breaking the silence.</p>

<p>When he came in, the supper-table was spread&mdash;herring
salad, decorated with red beets and slices
of hard boiled eggs, and a glass of brandy by the
side of it&mdash;and then half salted trout and a good
bottle of beer.</p>

<p>Father was possibly not quite insensible, but extremely
reticent. You could absolutely get only
words of one syllable in answer to the most ingeniously
conceived questions!</p>

<p>"The sheriff is going to marry again, they say; it
is absolutely certain!" he let fall at last, as the first
agreeable news he knew from the outer world;
"Scharfenberg's youngest."</p>

<p>The remark was followed by deep silence, even
if a gleam of perfect contentment glided over
Thinka's face, and she busied herself with eating.
They both felt that his ill-humor came from this.</p>

<p>"That man can say he is lucky with his daughters&mdash;Bine
soon in a parsonage, and now Andrea the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
sheriff's wife! Perhaps you can get a position there,
Thinka, when you need it some day, as governess
for the children, or housekeeper; she won't be
obliged to do more in the house than just what she
pleases; she can afford it."</p>

<p>Thinka, blushing to the roots of her hair, kept
her eyes on her plate.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Ma, as you make your bed you must
lie in it in this world."</p>

<p>No more was said before Thinka cleared off the
table, when Ma apologetically exclaimed, "Poor
Thinka!"</p>

<p>The captain wheeled towards her on the floor
with his fingers in the armholes of his vest and
blinked indignantly at her.</p>

<p>"Do you know! After the parasol and the one
attention after another which he has taken the pains
to show all summer, if she could have given the man
a bit of thanks and friendliness other than she has&mdash;It
would not have gone so at all, if I had been at
home!"&mdash;his voice rose to something like a peal
of thunder&mdash;"But I think it is a flock of geese that
I have here in the house, and not grown-up women
who look out a little for themselves. Andrea Scharfenberg
didn't let herself be asked twice, not she!"
he said, walking out again when Thinka came in;
he did not care if she did hear it.</p>

<p class="p3t">Ma gazed somewhat thoughtfully at him, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
days that followed, they petted and coddled father
in every way to make him a little more cheerful.
Thinka, in the midst of her quiet carefulness, cast
her eyes down involuntarily, when he groaned and
panted in this way.</p>

<p>He did not go out any farther than to look after
young Svarten.</p>

<p>The horse had fever in one hoof to-day after
the new shoeing. It was a nail which had been
driven in too far by that blockhead of a smith. It
must come out.</p>

<p>The captain stood silently looking on in his
favorite position, with his arms on the lower half
of the stable door, while Great-Ola, with the hind
leg of young Svarten over his leg, was performing
the operation of extraction with the tongs. The
animal was good-natured and did not so much as
move his leg.</p>

<p>"O-o-ola," came hoarsely, half smothered.</p>

<p>Great-Ola looked up.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" if the captain did not sink slowly
down, while he still held onto the stable door,
right on the dung!</p>

<p>Ola looked a moment irresolutely at his master,
dropping the horse's foot. Then he took the stable
pail and spattered some water into his face until
he once more manifested a little life and consciousness.</p>

<p>He then held the pail to his mouth.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"Drink, drink, Captain! Don't be afraid. It is
only the result of all that drilling and pleasuring.
It is just as it is when one has kept up a wedding
festivity too long. My brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Help me out, Ola! There, let me lean on
you&mdash;gently, gently. Ah, it does one good to
breathe&mdash;breathe," as he stopped. "Now it's over,
I believe. Yes, entirely over, nothing more than
a half fainting spell. Just go with me a little bit,
Ola, as a matter of precaution. Hm, hm, that goes
well enough. Yes, yes, I have no doubt it is the
irregular life the whole of the autumn. Go and call
my wife. Say I am up in the chamber. I can manage
the stairs bravely."</p>

<p>There was no little fright.</p>

<p>This time it was the captain who was at ease
and turned it off, and Ma who without authority
dispatched a messenger. If the army surgeon was
not at home, then he must go to the district doctor.</p>

<p>When the army surgeon, Rist, came, and had
received at the door Ma's anxious explanations
that J&#228;ger had had a slight shock, for the calming of
the house he delivered a humorous lecture.</p>

<p>It was wholly a question of degree. The man
who drank only so much that he stammered suffered
from paralytic palsy of the tongue&mdash;and in
this way every blessed man that he knew was a
paralytic patient. This was only a congestion not
uncommon among full-blooded people.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>J&#228;ger himself was in fact so far over it that he
demanded the toddy tray in the evening&mdash;true
enough, only an extremely light dose for his part!
But cock and bull stories from the encampment
and about Svarten were told in the clouds of smoke,
and with constant renewals of the thin essence, till
half-past one in the morning.</p>

<p class="p3t">There was a roaring in the stove on one of the
following forenoons, while the captain sat in his
office chair, and wrote so that his quill-pen sputtered.</p>

<p>As usual at this time of the year, after his long
absence, there was a great multitude of things to
be disposed of. Thea's Norwegian grammar was
lying on the green table by the door; she had just
finished reading, and was heard humming outside
in the hall.</p>

<p>There was a noise on the stairs, and Ma showing
some one the way up, "That way&mdash;to the
captain."</p>

<p>There was a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>"Good day, my man! Well?"</p>

<p>It was an express from the sheriff&mdash;in Sunday
dress&mdash;with a letter. It was to be given to the
captain himself.</p>

<p>"What? Is there to be an answer? Well, well!
Yes, go down to the kitchen and get a little something
to eat and a dram.&mdash;Hm, hm," he mumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
and threw the letter, written on letter-paper and
fastened with a seal, down on his desk, while in
the mean time he took a turn up and down the
floor. "Notice of the betrothal, I suppose&mdash;or
perhaps an invitation to the wedding."</p>

<p>Opening it, he read it, standing up&mdash;eagerly
running it over hastily&mdash;a cursed long introduction!&mdash;Over
that&mdash;over that&mdash;quite to the third
page.</p>

<p>"Well, there it comes!"</p>

<p>He struck the back of the hand in which he
held the letter with a resounding whack into the
other, and then seated himself&mdash;"Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes!"</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers, once, twice, three times,
in a brown study, scratched his head behind his
ear, and then slyly up under his wig.</p>

<p>"Now, we shall see&mdash;we shall see!&mdash;And that
nonsense about Scharfenberg." He rushed to the
door and jerked it open; but bethought himself
and walked on tiptoe to the stairs. "Who is there
in the hall&mdash;you, Thea?"</p>

<p>The little square-built, brown-eyed Thea flew
up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Tell Ma to come up," he said, nodding.</p>

<p>Thea looked up at her father: there was something
out of the ordinary about him.</p>

<p>When Ma came in, he walked about with the
letter behind his back, clearing his throat. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
was the suitable deliberate seriousness about him
which the situation demanded.</p>

<p>"I have got a letter, Ma&mdash;from the sheriff!&mdash;Read!&mdash;or
shall I read?"</p>

<p>He stood leaning against the desk, and went
through its three pages, period by period, with
great moderation, till he came to the point, then
he hurled it out so that it buzzed in the air, and
hugged Ma wildly.</p>

<p>"Well, well!&mdash;what do you say, Ma? Take a
trip when we want to go down to our son-in-law!"
He rubbed his hands. "It was a real surprise,
Ma,&mdash;hm, hm," he began, again clearing his throat.
"It is best that we ask Thinka to come up and
tell her the contents&mdash;don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," said Ma huskily, having turned to the
door; she could see no help or escape for her any
more, poor girl!</p>

<p>The captain walked up and down in the office,
waiting. He had the high-spirited, dignified, paternal
expression which is completely absorbed in the
importance of the moment.</p>

<p>But where was she gone to?</p>

<p>She could not be found. They had hunted for
her over the whole house.</p>

<p>But the captain was not impatient to-day.</p>

<p>"Well, then, don't you see her?" he mildly
asked two or three times through the door.</p>

<p>At last Thea found her in the garret. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
taken refuge up there and hid herself, when she
saw the express and heard that it was from the
sheriff, in anticipation of the contents. And now
she was sitting with her head on her arms and her
apron over her head.</p>

<p>She had not been crying; she had been seized
with a sort of panic; she felt an irresistible impulse
to hide herself away somewhere and shut her eyes,
so that it would be really dark, and she would not
be obliged to think.</p>

<p>She looked a little foolish when she went down
with Thea to her father and mother in the office.</p>

<p>"Thinka," said the captain, when she came in,
"we have received to-day from the sheriff an important
letter for your future. I suppose it is superfluous
to say&mdash;after all the attention you have allowed
him to show you during the year&mdash;what it
is about, and that your mother and I regard it as
the greatest good fortune that could fall to your lot,
and to ours also. Read the letter and consider it
well. Sit down and read it, child."</p>

<p>Thinka read; but it did not seem as if she got
far; she shook her head dumbly the whole time
without knowing it.</p>

<p>"You understand very well, it is not any youthful
love fancy, and any such exalted nonsense that
he asks of you. It is if you will fill an honored
position with him that you are asked, and if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
can give the good will and care for him which he
would naturally expect of a wife."</p>

<p>There was no answer to be got, except a weak
groan down into her lap.</p>

<p>The captain's face began to grow solemn.</p>

<p>But Ma whispered, with a blaze of lightning in
her eyes, "You see plainly, she cannot think, J&#228;ger.&mdash;Don't
you think as I do, father," she said aloud,
"that it is best we let Thinka take the letter, so
that she can consider it till to-morrow? It is such
a surprise."</p>

<p>"Of course, if Thinka prefers it," came after
them, from the captain, who was greatly offended, as
Ma went with her, shutting her up in her chamber.</p>

<p>She had her cry out under the down quilt during
the whole afternoon.</p>

<p>In the twilight Ma went up and sat beside her.</p>

<p>"No place to turn to, you see, when one will
not be a poor, unprovided-for member of a family.
Sew, sew your eyes out of your head, till at last
you lie in a corner of some one's house. Such an
honorable proposal would seem to many people to
be a great thing."</p>

<p>"Aas! Aas, mother!" articulated Thinka very
weakly.</p>

<p>"God knows, child, that if I saw any other way
out, I would show it to you, even if I should have
to hold my fingers in the fire in order to do it."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>Thinka slipped her hand onto her mother's thin
hand and sobbed gently into her pillow.</p>

<p>"Your father is no longer very strong&mdash;does
not bear many mental excitements,&mdash;so that the
outlook is dark enough. The attack when he came
home last&mdash;"</p>

<p>When Ma went out, sigh followed sigh in the
darkness.</p>

<p>Late in the evening Ma sat and held her daughter's
head so that she could get some sleep; she was
continually starting up.</p>

<p>And now when Thinka finally slept, without
these sudden starts any longer&mdash;quietly and peacefully,
with her fair young head regularly breathing
on the pillow&mdash;Ma went out with the candle. The
worst was over.</p>

<p>If the captain was in an exalted mood after having
seen from the office window Aslak, who went as
express messenger to the sheriff, vanishing through
the gate, then in certain ways he was doubly set
up in the kingdom of hope by a little fragment of
a letter from Inger-Johanna, dated Tilder&#246;d:</p>

<p class="p3t">We are all in a bustle, packing up and moving
to the city, therefore the letter will be short this
time.</p>

<p>There have been guests here to the very last;
solitude suits neither uncle nor aunt, and so they
had said "Welcome to Tilder&#246;d" so often that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
had one long visit after another all through the
summer&mdash;in perfect rusticity, it was said. But I
believe indeed they did not go away again without
feeling that aunt preserves style in it. With perfect
freedom for every one, and collations both in the
garden room and on the veranda, there is, after all,
something about it which makes the guests feel
that they must give something and be at their best.
People don't easily sink down to the level of the
commonplace when aunt is present. She flatters
me that we are alike in that respect.</p>

<p>And I don't know how it is, I feel now that I
am almost as much attracted by assemblies as formerly
by balls. There certainly is much more of an
opportunity to use whatever little wit one has, and
they may be a real influential circle of usefulness:
aunt has opened my eyes to that this summer.
When we read of the brilliant French <i>salons</i>, where
woman was the soul, we get an impression that here
is an entire province for her. And to be able to live
and work in the world has possessed me since I
was little, and mourned so that I was not a boy
who could come to be something.</p>

<p>I had got so far, dear parents, when Miss J&#246;rgensen
called me to go down into the garden to
aunt. The mail had come from the office in the
city, and on the table in a package lay a flat, red
morocco leather box and a letter to me.</p>

<p>It was a gold band to wear in my hair, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
yellow topaz in it, and in the letter there was only,
"To complete the portrait. <span class="smcap">R&#246;nnow.</span>"</p>

<p>Of course aunt must try it on me at once&mdash;take
down my hair, and call in uncle. R&#246;nnow's taste
was subtly inspired when it concerned me, she declared.</p>

<p>Oh, yes! it is becoming.</p>

<p>But with the letter and all the fantastical overvaluation,
there is that which makes me feel that
the gold band pinches my neck. Gratitude is a tiresome
virtue.</p>

<p>Aunt lays so many plans for our social life next
winter, and is rejoicing that R&#246;nnow may possibly
come for another trip.</p>

<p>For my part I must say I don't really know; I
both want it and don't want it.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter X</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> more quickly and quietly the wedding
could be arranged, the better, said the sheriff.
It had its advantage in getting ahead of explanations
and gossip. People submitted to an accomplished
fact.</p>

<p>The third day of Christmas was just the right
one to escape too much sensation; and it suited
the sheriff exactly, so that he could enter upon his
new state of household affairs with the new year.</p>

<p>Naturally, Kathinka was asked about every one
of these points; and she always found everything
that her father thought right.</p>

<p>The decision that the wedding should be arranged
speedily and promptly was exactly after the
captain's own heart. On the other point, on the
contrary, that everything should be kept so quiet
and still, he was in agreement with the sheriff and
Ma, of course; but it really did not lie in his nature
that the whole joyful affair should take place
smothered with a towel before his mouth, and
whispering on tiptoe, as if it were a sick-room they
were having at Gilje instead of a wedding.</p>

<p>Some show there must be about it; that he owed
to Thinka, and to himself also a little.</p>

<p>And thus it came about that before Christmas
he took a little sleighing trip, when it was good
going, down to the lieutenant's and to the solicitors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Scharfenberg and Sebelow, with whom he had some
money settlements to get adjusted in regard to the
map business that had been done in the last two
suits.</p>

<p>And then, when he met the report that the banns
had been published in church for his daughter and
the sheriff, he could answer with a question if they
would not come and convince themselves. Confidentially,
of course, he invited no one but the army
surgeon and those absolutely necessary. "But"&mdash;winking&mdash;"old
fellow, how welcome you shall be,
the third day of Christmas, not the second and not
the fourth, my boy, remember that!"</p>

<p>And he took care that provisions as well as batteries
of strong liquors should be stored up inside
the ramparts at home, so the fortress could hold
its own.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve there came a horse express
from the sheriff with a sleigh full of packages&mdash;nothing
but presents and surprises for Thinka.</p>

<p>First and foremost, his former wife's warm fur
cloak with squirrel-skin lining and muff, which had
been made over for Thinka by Miss Brun in the
chief parish; then her gold watch and chain with
earrings, and rings, all like new, and burnished up
by the goldsmith in the city, and a Vienna shawl,
and, lastly, lavender water and gloves in abundance.</p>

<p>In the letter he suggested to his devotedly loved
Kathinka that his thoughts were only with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
until they should soon be united by a stronger
bond, and that she, when once in her new home,
would find several other things which might possibly
please her, but which it would not be practical
to send up to Gilje, only to bring them right
back again.</p>

<p>He had not brought Baldrian and Viggo home
for Christmas&mdash;and in this he hoped she would
agree with him; he had sent them down to his
brother, the minister at Holmestrand.</p>

<p>Never in Great-Ola's time had there been such
a festive show in horses and vehicles, as when, on
the third day of Christmas, they started down the
hill to the annex-church; the harnesses and bells
shone, and both the black horses glistened before
the double sleighs, as if they had been polished up,
both hair and mane.</p>

<p>Under the bearskin robe in the first sat the captain
in a wolf-skin coat and Thinka adorned with
the chains and clothes of the sheriff's first wife,
with young Svarten. In the second Ma and Thea,
with Great-Ola on the dickey seat behind and old
Svarten.</p>

<p>There stood the subalterns in uniform paying
their respects at the church door; and inside, in the
pew, Lieutenants Dunsack, Frisak, Knebelsberger,
and Knobelauch rose up in full uniform. So the
sheriff could see that there was some style about
it, anyway.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>And when they turned towards home, after the
ceremony was over, now with the captain and his
wife in the first sleigh and the wedded couple in
the other&mdash;there was such a long cort&#232;ge that the
sheriff's idea of celebrating the wedding quietly
must be regarded as wholly overridden.</p>

<p>At Gilje dinner was waiting.</p>

<p>During this the powers of the battalion from the
youngest lieutenant up to the captain developed
a youthful courage in their attack on the strong
wares, so wild and so regardless of the results, that
it could only demand of the sheriff a certain degree
of prudence.</p>

<p>All would drink with the bride and the bridegroom,
again and again.</p>

<p>The sheriff sat contented and leaning forward
with his great forehead thinly covered with hair,
taking pains to choose his words in the cleverest
and most fitting manner for the occasion.</p>

<p>And so long as it was confined to the speeches,
he was the absolute master, unless he might possibly
have a rival in the army surgeon's sometimes
more deeply laid satire, which became more problematical
and sarcastic after he had been drinking.</p>

<p>But now the small twinkling eyes, shining more
and more dimly and tenderly veiled, devoted themselves
exclusively to the bride.</p>

<p>She must taste the tower tart and the wine custard,
for his sake! He would not drink any more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
if he could avoid it, for her sake. "I assure you,"
for your&mdash;"only for your sake."</p>

<p>An inroad was made on the wares at Gilje with
prolonged hilarity till far into the night, when some
of the sleighs in the starlight and in the gleam of
the Northern lights reeled homewards with their
half unconscious burdens drawn by their sober
horses, while as many as the house would hold
remained over in order to celebrate the wedding
and Christmas the next day.</p>

<p>By New Year's the house was finally emptied of
its guests, the sheriff and Kathinka were installed
in their home, and the captain travelled down on a
visit to them with Thea in order to have his New
Year's Day spree there.</p>

<p>But then Ma was tired out and completely exhausted.</p>

<p>She felt, now the wheel of work had stopped all
at once, and she sat there at home alone, on the day
after New Year's, how tremendous a load it had
been to pull. The trousseau all through the autumn
and the household affairs before the holidays,
Christmas, and the wedding, and all the anxieties.</p>

<p>It had gone on incessantly now, as far back as
she could think. It was like ravelling out the yarn
from a stocking, the longer she thought, the longer
it was, clear back to the time when it seemed to her
there was a rest the days she was lying in childbed.</p>

<p>But that was now long since.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>She was sitting in the corner of the sofa half
asleep in the twilight, with her knitting untouched
before her.</p>

<p>Aslak and two of the girls had got leave to go
to a Christmas entertainment down at the Skreberg
farm, and except old Torbj&#246;rg, who was sitting
with her hymn book and humming and singing
in the kitchen, there was no one at home.</p>

<p>Bells jingled out in the yard. Great-Ola had
come home with the two-seated sleigh and old
Svarten, after having driven the captain and Thea.</p>

<p>He stamped the snow off in the hall and peeped
in through the door.</p>

<p>When he drove past Teigen, the postmaster
had come out with the captain's mail.</p>

<p>"When did you get there last evening? I hope
Thea was not cold."</p>

<p>"No, not at all! We were down there in good
time before supper. Ever so many messages from
the young wife; she was down in the stable and
patted and stroked Svarten last night. It was kind
of a separation."</p>

<p>Ma rose. "There is a candle laid out for the
stable lantern."</p>

<p>Great-Ola vanished again.</p>

<p>Old Svarten, still harnessed to the sleigh, stood
in the stable door and neighed impatiently.</p>

<p>"It only lacked that you should turn the key
also," growled Ola, while he took off the harness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
and, now with the harness and bells over his arm,
let the horse walk in before him.</p>

<p>"Why, if young Svarten isn't neighing also!
That was the first time you have said a decent good
day here in the stable, do you know that? But you
will have to wait, you see."</p>

<p>He curried and brushed and rubbed the new
arrival like a privileged old gentleman. They
had been serving together now just exactly nine
years.</p>

<p>In the kitchen the spruce wood crackled and
snapped on the hearth, casting an uncertain reddish
glow over Ma's newly polished copper and tin
dishes and making them look like mystical shields
and weapons hung on the walls.</p>

<p>Great-Ola was now sitting there making himself
comfortable with his supper, Christmas cheer and
entertainment&mdash;butter, bread, bacon, wort-cakes,
and salt meat; and Torbj&#246;rg had been ordered to
draw a bowl of small beer for him down in the cellar.
Ola had heard one thing and another down there.</p>

<p>Thinka, she had gone out into the kitchen and
would take charge of the housekeeping immediately.
But there she found some one who meant to hold
the reins.</p>

<p>Old Miss G&#252;lcke wouldn't hear of that. She
went straight up to the office, they said, and twisted
and turned it over with her brother the whole forenoon
till she got what she wanted.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>And in the evening the sheriff sat on the sofa
and talked so sweetly to the young wife. Beret, the
chamber-maid, heard him say that he wanted her
to have everything so extremely nice and be wholly
devoted to him, so that&mdash;Horsch, the old graybeard!
We can see now what he was doing here last
year.</p>

<p>"And thereby," said Ola, with a mouthful between
his teeth, while he cut and spread a new slice
of bread, "she got rid of the trouble and the management
too."</p>

<p>"It is of no use to pull the noose when one has
his head in a snare, you see, Ola."</p>

<p>In the sitting-room Ma had examined the mail
that had come, sitting by the stove door. Besides
a number of <i>Hermoder</i>, <i>The Constitutional</i>, and a free
official document, there was a letter from Aunt
Alette.</p>

<p>She lighted the candle and sat down to read it.</p>

<p>In certain respects it was a piece of good fortune
that J&#228;ger was not at home. He ought to have
nothing to do with this.</p>

<p class="p3t"><span class="smcap">Dear Gitta</span>,&mdash;I have taken the second Christmas
day to write down for you my thoughts concerning
Inger-Johanna. I cannot deny that she has come
to interest me almost more than I could wish; but,
if we can feel a certain degree of anxiety for the
smallest flower in our window, which is just going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
to blossom, how much more then for a human bud,
which in the developing beauty of its youth is ready
to burst out with its life's fate. This is more than
a romance, it is the noble art work of the Guide of
all, which in depth and splendor and immeasurable
wealth surpasses everything that human fantasy is
able to represent.</p>

<p>Yes, she interests me, dear Gitta! so that my old
heart almost trembles at thinking of the life path
which may await her, when rise or fall may depend
on a single deceptive moment.</p>

<p>What can Nature mean in letting such a host of
existences, in which hearts are beating, succumb
and be lost in this choice, or does it thereby in its
great crucible make an exact assay, without which
nothing succeeds in passing over into a more complete
development&mdash;who can unriddle Nature's
runes? My hope for Inger-Johanna is that the fund
or the weight of personality, which she possesses
in her own nature, will preponderate in the scales
of her choice in the decisive moment.</p>

<p>I premise all this as a sigh from my innermost
heart; for I follow with increasing dread how the
path is made more and more slippery under her feet,
and how delicately your sister-in-law weaves the
net around her, not with small means to which
Inger-Johanna would be superior, but with more
deep-lying, sounding allurements.</p>

<p>To open up the fascinating prospect of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
her personal qualities and gifts count&mdash;what greater
attraction can be spread out before a nature so ardently
aspiring as hers? It is told of Englishmen
that they fish with a kind of counterfeited, glittering
flies, which they drag over the surface of the
water until the fish bites; and it appears to me that
in no less skilful manner your sister-in-law continually
tempts Inger-Johanna's illusions. She never
mentions the name of the one concerned, so that
it may dawn upon her of itself.</p>

<p>Only the careless hint to me, in her hearing,
the last time I was there, that R&#246;nnow had certainly
for some time been rather fastidiously looking
for a wife among the <i>&#233;lite</i> of our ladies&mdash;why
was not that calculated to excite, what shall I call
it, her ambition or her need of having a field of
influence?</p>

<p>Perhaps I should not have noticed this remark
to that extent if I had not seen the impression it
made on her; she was very absent-minded and lost
in thoughts.</p>

<p>And yet the question of whether one should
give her heart away ought to be so simple and
uncomplicated! Are you in love? Everything else
only turns on&mdash;something else.</p>

<p>The unfortunate and fateful thing is if she imagines
she is able to love, binds herself in duty to
love, and thinks that she can say to her immature
heart: You shall never awaken. Dear Gitta, suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
it did awaken&mdash;afterwards&mdash;with her strong,
vigorous nature?</p>

<p>It is that which hovers before me so that I have
been compelled to write. To talk to her and make
her prudent would be to show colors to the blind;
she must believe blindly in the one who advises
her. Therefore it is you, Gitta, who must take hold
and write.</p>

<p class="p3t">Ma laid the letter down in her lap; she sat in the
light, looking paler and sharper even than common.</p>

<p>It was easy for Aunt Alette, the excellent Aunt
Alette, to think so happily that everything should
be as it ought to be. She had her little inheritance to
live on and was not dependent on any one. But&mdash;Ma
assumed a dry, repellent expression&mdash;without
the four thousand, old and tormented in Miss
J&#246;rgensen's place at the governor's, she would not
have written that kind of angelic letter.</p>

<p>Ma read on:</p>

<p class="p3t">I must also advance here some further doubts, so
that you will certainly think this is a sad Christmas
letter. This, then, is about dear J&#246;rgen, who finds
it so hard at school. That he has thus far been able
to keep up with his class, we owe to Student Grip,
who, persistently and without being willing ever to
hear a word about any compensation, has gone over
with him and cleared up for him his worst stumbling-blocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the German and the Latin grammar.</p>

<p>And if I now express his idea in regard to J&#246;rgen,
it is with no small degree of confidence that it may
be well founded. He says that so far from J&#246;rgen's
having a poor head, it is just the opposite. Only
he is not made for the abstract, which is the requisite
for literary progress, but all the more for the
practical.</p>

<p>In connection with a sound, clear judgment, he
is both dexterous and inventive. J&#246;rgen would be
an excellent mechanic or even a mechanical engineer,
and would come to distinguish himself just as
certainly as he will reap trouble, difficulty, and only
extremely moderate results by toiling from examination
to examination in his studies.</p>

<p>To be sure, I cannot subscribe to Student Grip's
somewhat youthful wild ideas about sending him to
be an apprentice in England (or even so far as to
the American Free States!) inasmuch as a mechanic
cannot here obtain a respected rank in society, such
as is said to be the case in the above named lands.</p>

<p>Still, much of this, it seems to me, is worth taking
into serious consideration.</p>

<p>I sometimes almost doubt whether, old as I am,
nevertheless I might be too young. Call it the fruit
of inner development or simply an attraction, but
the thoughts of the young always exert an enlivening
and strengthening influence on my hope of
life. Still, I never reconcile myself to the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
that our ideals must inevitably, by a kind of natural
law, become exhausted and weakened and break
from age like any old earthenware.</p>

<p>And when I see a young man like Grip judged
so severely by the so-called practical men&mdash;not, so
far as I understand, for his ideas of education, but
because he would sacrifice himself and put them in
operation&mdash;I cannot avoid giving him my whole
sympathy and respect.</p>

<p>Now he has abandoned law and devoted himself
to the study of philology; for, he says, in this country
no work is of any use without a sign-board, and
he will now try to get a richly gilded one in an excellent
examination, seize hold of untrodden soil,
like the dwarf birches upon the mountain, and not
let go, even if a whole avalanche comes over him.</p>

<p>When it is considered that he must work hard
and teach several hours daily only to be able to exist,
I cannot but admire his fiery courage and&mdash;true,
I have not many with me&mdash;wish him good luck.</p>

<p class="p3t">Ma sat pondering.</p>

<p>Then she cut out the page which spoke of
J&#246;rgen. It might be worth while, if opportunity offered,
to show it to J&#228;ger. In the simplicity of her
heart, she really did not know what to think.</p>

<div class="chapter">
                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>
<h2><i>Chapter XI</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Everything</span> was white now in the very
heart of winter, white from the window-panes
in the sitting-room to the garden, the fields, and
the mountain slopes, white as the eye glided over
the mountain-tops up to the sky, which lay like a
semi-transparent, thickly frosted window-pane and
shut it all in.</p>

<p>It was cold here, the warm-blooded captain maintained.
He began to amuse himself with feeling and
tracing out where there was a draught, and then
with pasting long strips of paper with cloth and
oakum under it. And then he used to go out from
his work, with only his wig, without his hat, and
chat with the people in the stable or at the barn,
where they were threshing.</p>

<p>They were lonely there now with only Ma, Thea,
and himself; no one understood what Thinka had
been for him!</p>

<p>At last he ended in pondering on laying out fox-traps
and traps and spring-guns for wolves and lynx
in the hill pastures.</p>

<p>Ma was obliged a hundred times a day to answer
what she thought, even if she had just as much idea
about it as about pulling down the moon.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, do it, dear J&#228;ger."</p>

<p>"Yes, but do you believe it will pay&mdash;that is what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
I am asking about&mdash;to go to the expense of fox-traps?"</p>

<p>"If you can catch any, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A fox skin is certainly worth something."</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better try to put out bait for lynx and
wolf?"</p>

<p>"I should think that would be dearer."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the skin&mdash;if I get any; it depends on
that, you see."</p>

<p>Then he would saunter thoughtfully out of the
door, to come back an hour later and again and again
fill her ears with the same thing.</p>

<p>Ma's instinct told her that the object of his first
catch was really she; if she allowed herself to be
fooled into giving positive advice, he would not forget
to let her feel the responsibility for the result,
if it should be a loss.</p>

<p>To-day he had again been pondering and going
over the affair with her, when they were surprised by
the sheriff's double sleigh driving up to the steps.</p>

<p>The hall door, creaking with the frost, flew open
under the captain's eager hand.</p>

<p>"In with you into the sitting-room, Sheriff."</p>

<p>Behind his wolf-skin coat Thinka emerged,
stately and wrapped up in furs.</p>

<p>"Your most obedient servant, kinsman, and
friend."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>The sheriff was on a business trip farther up, and
asked for hospitality for Thinka for two or three
days, till he came back; he would not omit to claim
her again promptly. And, in the next place, he must
ask of his father-in-law the loan of a small sleigh for
his further journey; he should be way up in Nordal's
annex this evening.</p>

<p>Thinka already had Torbj&#246;rg and Thea competing
each for one of her snow-stockings to get
them off, and Marit was not free from eagerly
peeping in at the door.</p>

<p>"You shall, in any event, have a little something
to eat and some tea-punch, while the horse gets its
breath, and they make the sleigh ready."</p>

<p>The sheriff did not have much time to waste, but
the sun of family life shone too mildly here for him
not to give a half hour, exactly by the clock.</p>

<p>He made one or two attempts to get his things
off, but then went to Thinka.</p>

<p>"You have tied the knot in my silk handkerchief
so well that you will have to undo it yourself.
Thanks, thanks, my dear Thinka.&mdash;She spoils me
completely. Nay, you know her, Captain."</p>

<p>"You see what she has already begun to be for
me," he said later, appealing with a pleasant smile
to his father-in-law and mother-in-law at the hastily
served collation&mdash;he must have his tea-punch
poured out by Thinka's hand.</p>

<p>When the sheriff, carefully wrapped up by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
young wife, was followed out to the sleigh, Thinka's
tea stood there almost untouched and cold; but Ma
came now with a freshly filled hot cup, and they
could sit down to enjoy the return home in peace.</p>

<p>He is certainly very good, Ma thought&mdash;he had
guessed that Thinka was homesick.</p>

<p>"The sheriff is really very considerate of you,
Thinka, to let you come home so soon," she said.</p>

<p>"Fine man! Would have to hunt a long time for
his like!" exclaimed the captain with a full, strong
bass. "Treats you like a doll, Thinka."</p>

<p>"He is as good as he can be. Next week Miss
Brun is coming to make over a satin dress for me;
it has only been worn once. G&#252;lcke will have me so
fine," said Thinka, by way of illustration. The tone
was so quiet that it was not easy for Ma to tell what
she meant.</p>

<p>"The fellow stands on his head for you; don't
know what he will hit upon."</p>

<p>Besides his wish to meet his wife's longing for
home, the sheriff may possibly also have determined
to take her with him from a little regard for
the younger powers in the principal parish&mdash;Buchholtz
and Horn. They had begun to visit at his
house somewhat often and evidently to feel at home
there, after a young, engaging hostess had come to
the house.</p>

<p>Towards evening the captain had a quiet game
of picquet.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed as if comfort accompanied Thinka.
Her mediatorial and soothing nature had come to
the house again; it was felt both in parlor and
kitchen.</p>

<p>Father came again in the forenoon for a little
portion of oat cake and whey cheese when they were
cooking salt meat and peas in the kitchen, and Ma
found first one thing and then another done for her
and was anticipated in many handy trifles, notwithstanding
that Thinka also had to finish a pair of
embroidered slippers that G&#252;lcke had expressed a
wish for. But there was plenty of time for that. She
got well along on the pattern while her father was
taking his noonday nap, and she sat up there and
read him to sleep.</p>

<p>The captain found it so comfortable when he saw
the needle and worsted flying in Thinka's hand&mdash;it
was so peacefully quiet&mdash;it was impossible not to
go to sleep.</p>

<p>And then he was going to have her for only three
days.</p>

<p>While her fingers were moving over the canvas,
Kathinka sat having a solitary meditation&mdash;</p>

<p>Aas had sent her a letter when he heard of her
marriage. He had believed in her so that he could
have staked his life on her constancy, and even if
many years were to have passed, he would have
worked, scrimped, and scraped in order at last to
have been able to reach her again, even if they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
then both have left their youth behind them. It had
been his joyful hope that she would keep firm and
wait for him even through straits and poor circumstances.
But now that she had sold herself for goods
and gold, he did not believe in any one any more.
He had only one heart, not two; but the misfortune
was, he saw it more plainly, that she also had&mdash;</p>

<p>"Huf! I thought I heard you sighing deeply,"
said the captain, waking up; "that comes from lying
and struggling on one's back. Now we shall have
some coffee."</p>

<p>Even if Thinka could not answer Aas, still she
would try to relieve her heart a little to Inger-Johanna.
She had brought her last letter with her
to answer in this period of calm at home, and was
sitting up in her room with it before her, in the
evening.</p>

<p>"Inger-Johanna is fortunate, as she has nothing
else to think of," she said to herself, sighing and
reading:</p>

<p class="p3t">And you, Thinka, you also ought to have your
eye on your part of the country, and make something
out of the place into which you have now
come; it is indeed needed up there, for there is no
doubt that society has its great mission in the refinement
of customs and the contest against the
crude, as aunt expresses it.</p>

<p>I am not writing this for nothing, nor wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
in the air; I stand, indeed, too near to many conditions
to be able to avoid thinking of the possibility
of sometime being placed in such a position.
If I said anything else, I should not be sincere.</p>

<p>And I must tell you, I see a great many things
I should like to help in. It must be that a place
can be found for a good many ideas which now,
as it were, are excommunicated.</p>

<p>Society ought to be tolerant, aunt says; why,
then, cannot such views as Grip's be discussed
peacefully? The first thing I would do would be
to go in for being extravagant and defending them.
In a woman, nevertheless, this is never anything
more than piquancy. But ideas also must fight
their way into good society.</p>

<p>I ponder and think more than you can imagine;
I feel that I ought to put something right, you see.</p>

<p>And I am not any longer so struck with the
wisdom of men altogether. A woman like aunt
keeps silent and pulls the strings; but you can
never imagine how many are led by her strings.
She is, between ourselves, a little diplomatic, in an
old-fashioned way, and full of flourishes, so that
she almost makes it a pleasure to have it go unobserved
and by a roundabout way. Straight out
would many times be better, I believe; at any rate,
that is my nature.</p>

<p>And still a little warning with it, Thinka (oh, how
I feel I speak as if I were in aunt's skin!) Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
that no one ever rules a room except from a
place on the sofa; I know you are so modest that
they are always getting you off on the chairs. You
are not at all so stupid as you imagine; only you
ought not to try to hide what you think.</p>

<p>If I should sometime meet Grip again, I should
convince him that there may be other ways to
Rome than just going head foremost at it! I have
got a little notion of my own since he last domineered
me, with his contempt for society, and was
always so superior. But I have not had more than
one or two glimpses of him on the street the whole
winter. He is so taken up by his own affairs; and
it isn't proper, uncle says, to invite him to <i>soir&#233;es</i>,
since he has pledged himself to certain strong ideas,
which one does not dare to hint at without provoking
a very serious dispute. In one or two gentlemen
parties he has been entirely too grandiloquent&mdash;drank
too much, uncle thought. But I
know so well why. He must hit upon something, he
used to say, when he gets tired and bored too much,
and at the D&#252;rings there is a dreadful vacuum.</p>

<p class="p3t">Thinka had read the letter through; there might
be much to think of, but she was so taken up by
Aas&mdash;she was never done with rolling that millstone.</p>

<p>During the monotony of winter, in the middle of
February, a letter was received, which the captain
at first weighed in his hand and examined two or
three times&mdash;white, glossy vellum paper, C. R. in
the seal&mdash;and he tore it open.</p>

<p>Yes, to be sure, it was from R&#246;nnow!&mdash;his
brilliant, running hand with the peculiar swing,
which brought him to mind, as his elegant form,
with a jaunty tread, moved up and down.</p>


<p class="p3t"><span class="smcap">Captain Peter J&#228;ger</span>,&mdash;Highly esteemed, dear
old comrade and friend:</p>

<p>I shall not preface this with any long preludes
about position in life, prospects, etc., but go straight
on with my prayer and request.</p>

<p>As you have seen that my cards are lucky&mdash;really
more as they have been dealt than as I have
played them&mdash;you will certainly understand that
in the last two or three years I have found it proper
to look about for a wife and a partner for life who
would be suitable for my condition. But during
the whole of my seeking there was hidden in the
most secret corner of my heart a black-haired, dark-eyed
girl, whom I first saw by the card-table one
winter evening up at Gilje, and whom I have since
seen again and again with ever more fascination
during her development into the proud woman and
lady whose superior nature was incontestable.</p>

<p>Now, with my round six-and-forty years, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
not hold forth with any long tale of my love for her,
although, perhaps, there might be a good deal to say
on that point also. That I am not old inwardly
I have at all events fully found out on this occasion.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that I do not address my
prayer to you without having first satisfied myself
by a close and long acquaintance that your daughter
also could cherish some feelings responsive to
mine.</p>

<p>That the result has not been to my disadvantage
is apparent from her precious reply to me, received
yesterday, in which I have her yes and consent.</p>

<p>In the hope that a sincere conduct and intention
will not be misconstrued, I herewith address the
prayer and the question to you and your dear wife&mdash;whether
you will trust to me the future of your
precious Inger-Johanna?</p>

<p>What a man can do to smooth and make easy
her path of life, that I dare promise, on my <i>parole
d'honneur</i>, she shall never lack.</p>

<p>I will also add that when the court, towards the
end of May or the early part of June, goes to Christiania,
I shall be on duty and go too. I shall then
be able again to see her on whom all my hope and
longing are placed.</p>

<p>In anxious expectation of your honored answer,</p>

<p class="sigright">Most respectfully,&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;<br />
Your always faithful friend,<br />
<span class="smcap">Carsten R&#246;nnow</span></p>

<p>Here was something better to think about than
to talk with Ma about fox-traps and spring-guns.</p>

<p>There would not be any after-dinner nap to-day.</p>

<p>He rushed out into the yard with great force:
another man must thresh in the barn; the manure
must be drawn out; they must hurry!</p>

<p>He came in and seated himself on the sofa and
lighted a lamplighter, but jumped up again while
he held it to his pipe. He remembered that a message
must be sent to the smith to mend the harrows
and tools for spring.</p>

<p>There was no help for it, he must go down and
tell the news to the sheriff himself.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter XII</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">During</span> the first days of March Inger-Johanna
wrote:</p>

<p class="p3t">This comes so close upon my former, because I
have just received a letter from R&#246;nnow about
something on which I would gladly, dear parents,
have you stand on my side, when you, as I foresee,
receive aunt's explicit and strong representation
and reasons in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>R&#246;nnow already writes as if it were something
certain and settled that we should have the wedding
in the summer, in June or July. Aunt wants
it at her house, and hopes that, in any event, you,
father, will come down.</p>

<p>R&#246;nnow urges so many amiable considerations
which speak for it, and I do not at all doubt that
aunt in her abundant kindness will take care to
make it doubly sure with a four-page letter full of
reasons.</p>

<p>But against all this I have only one thing to say,
that I, at the time I gave my consent to R&#246;nnow,
did not at all foresee such haste without, as it were,
a little time and breathing-space for myself.</p>

<p>It is possible that others cannot understand this
feeling of mine, and especially it seems that aunt
thinks it does not exactly show the degree of heartiness
of feeling that R&#246;nnow could expect.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>But to the last, which is certainly the only one
of the whole number she can urge that is worth
answering, I will only say, that it cannot possibly
be R&#246;nnow's intent to offend my innermost sensibilities
when he learns how I feel about it.</p>

<p>I only ask for suitable time&mdash;for instance, till
some time next winter. I should so much like to
have this year, summer and autumn at least, a little
in quiet and peace. There is so much to think over,
among other things my future position. I want first
to study the French grammar through, and I
should prefer to do it at home alone, and generally
to prepare myself. It is not merely like jumping
into a new silk dress.</p>

<p>Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish I could be at Gilje this
summer! I sat yesterday thinking how delightful
it was there last year on the high mountains!</p>

<p>No, aunt and I would not agree permanently.
Her innermost, innermost peculiarity (let it be
never so well enveloped in amiability and gentle
ways of speech) is that she is tyrannical. Therefore
she wants now to manage my wedding, and therefore&mdash;which
can now vex and disturb me, so that I
haven't words for it!&mdash;she has in these days got my
good-natured (but not especially strong-minded,
it would be a pity to say that!) uncle to commit the
act, which is far from being noble, of dismissing
Grip from his position in the office. It is just like
robbing him of half of what is needed to enable him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
to live and study here, and that only because she
does not tolerate his ideas.</p>

<p>I let her know plainly what I thought about it,
that it was both heartless and intolerant; I was so
moved.</p>

<p>But why she pursues him to the seventh and last&mdash;for
with aunt there is always something for the
seventh and last&mdash;that I should still like to know.</p>

<p class="p3t">Regard must naturally be paid to Inger-Johanna's
wish to postpone the wedding. And so there was
writing and writing to and fro.</p>

<p>But then came R&#246;nnow's new promotion and
with it the practical consideration, which weighed
on the scales, that housekeeping must be begun on
moving-day in October.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There was a general brushing up at Gilje from
top to bottom, inside and out. The rooms upstairs
must be whitened and everything put in order for
the arrival of the newly married couple to remain
this summer, the whole of July, after the
wedding.</p>

<p>And when Inger-Johanna should come she was
to meet a surprise&mdash;the whole of the captain's
residence, by order of the army department, newly
painted red with red-lead and white window sashes.</p>

<p>The captain's every-day coat had a shower of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
spots at all times in the day, as he stood out by the
painter's ladder and watched the work&mdash;first the
priming and now the second coat; then came the
completion, the third and last. The spring winds
blew, so that the walls dried almost immediately.</p>

<p>He was a little dizzy off and on during all this,
so that he must stop and recover his balance; but
there was good reason for it, because the parish
clerk this year had not taken enough blood, since
he had become so much stouter!&mdash;and then perhaps
he pushed on too hard and eagerly; for he did
long for Inger-Johanna's return.</p>

<p>He talked of nothing but Inger-Johanna, of her
prospects, beauty, and talents, and how Ma could
not deny that he had seen what there was in her
from the time when she was very small.</p>

<p>But Ma still thought privately, while he was going
about boisterous and happy, that he had been
less stout and more healthy when he had more
anxieties and had to take the world harder. She had
let him into the secret of Aunt Alette's misgivings
in respect to J&#246;rgen's capacities for scholarship.</p>

<p>"I have not been able to avoid thinking, J&#228;ger,
that J&#246;rgen might not find happiness in that line."</p>

<p>"In what line, then?&mdash;Be a shoemaker and lie
on one knee and take the measure of us others, perhaps&mdash;Oh-ho,
no," stretching himself with superabundant
conviction, "if we can afford to keep him
at his studies, he can easily learn. There are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
more stupid than he who have attained the position
of both minister and sheriff."</p>

<p>One day the captain hastily separated a letter
from Aunt Alette from his official mail, and threw
it on the table for Ma to read through at her convenience.
If there was anything in it, she could tell
it to him, he shouted back, as he went up the stairs
to his office; he had become a great deal heavier
and more short of breath lately, and took a firmer
hold on the stair rail.</p>


<p class="sigright p3t"><i>May 1, 1844</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Gitta</span>,&mdash;It is with a certain sad, subdued
feeling that I write to you this time; nay, I
could even wish to characterize it by a stronger
expression. It comes to my old ears as if there was
a lamentation sounding over so many bright hopes
bowing their heads to the ground; and I can only
find consolation in the firm faith, cherished through
a long life, that nothing happens save as a link in
a higher wisdom.</p>

<p>Just as I have hitherto tried to present everything
relating to Inger-Johanna as clearly before
you as I could see it myself, so I find it most proper
not to conceal from you the struggle which she
plainly is going through against a feeling, from
whose power I hope there may yet be salvation in
the fortunate circumstance that it has not yet had
full time to come into being and ripen in her.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>It is there, and it produces pain, but more, is my
hope, as a possibility, which has not put out sufficient
roots, than as a reality, a living growth, which
could not, without injury to her innermost being,
coldly be subdued and stifled again.</p>

<p>But never has shrewd calculation celebrated a
more sorry triumph than when the governor's wife
believed that she could find a remedy by keeping
the person concerned at a distance and at last even
by persecuting him, in order to make it impossible
for him to support himself here. When it is considered
that Inger-Johanna, during all the treatment
that Grip has endured for his ideas, has
plainly sympathized with, almost championed them,
the result should not have been difficult to foresee.</p>

<p>And one cold, frosty morning early this winter,
Inger-Johanna came here in great mental excitement
to make an examination into his condition
through J&#246;rgen. It was then also at her appeal
that J&#246;rgen asked him to teach him four hours a
week.</p>

<p>On this occasion I saw clearly what before I had
only suspected, but which had not escaped your
sister-in-law's sharp eye, that Student Grip, without
Inger-Johanna's having any idea of it, had engrossed
her as a personality that drew her more and
more.</p>

<p>It is of no use to conceal it; it is a crisis which
must be fought through, before she finally becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
any other person's, if her position is not to be a false
one, and if she is not to support a lifelong sorrow.</p>

<p>That the news of her betrothal has fallen like
a saddening disappointment of a hope (even if a
remote one) on this young man, I regard as far
from improbable.</p>

<p>I certainly cannot forget the two serious young
faces, which for a moment stood looking at each
other, when they met in my room one afternoon.
There was not much said.</p>

<p>She knew that he had been wronged and she
hinted something to that effect.</p>

<p>"Possibly, Miss J&#228;ger," he said harshly, while
he took hold of the door-knob. "So many soap-bubbles
burst."</p>

<p>Inger-Johanna remained standing and looking
down on the floor. It was as if an entire change had
come over her; I am sure it dawned upon her what
he felt.</p>

<p>The discharge from the governor's bureau has
plainly enough been welcome to many of the families
which immediately after with singular quickness
seized the opportunity to dismiss him as tutor.
A man of such strangely discordant ideas had
long been thought not quite desirable to receive.
And the example had been given.</p>

<p>From an honest heart I offered him a loan, so
that he might live in peace for two or three months
and study, until he could again get places to teach;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
but either he was too sore and proud, or else he
thought that Inger-Johanna had a hand in it.</p>

<p>He has certainly taken it very much to heart that
the total want of means of existence has now compelled
him to give up the school, which was his
pride, so that he is now in a certain way an object
of ridicule, and this has capped the climax.</p>

<p>He goes about unoccupied, so J&#246;rgen reports,
and asks for credit at eating-houses and restaurants,
where he sits out the evening and night.</p>

<p>I understood well enough that it was not just for
the sake of her old aunt or for the thing itself, but
to hear about him, that Inger-Johanna sat with me
so often and learned the old-fashioned stitch with
pearls and gold thread. She was in such an excited
condition and so abstracted, and jumped up when
J&#246;rgen came home towards evening and, more's the
pity, as often as not had been looking for him in
vain to read with him.</p>

<p>That pale, darkly brilliant face stands so before
me, Gitta, with which she one evening broke out:
"Aunt&mdash;Aunt&mdash;Aunt Alette!"</p>

<p>It was like a hidden cry.</p>

<p>Where he is living now, J&#246;rgen has not succeeded
in finding out; possibly for want of means
he has been turned out of his lodgings.</p>

<p>I narrate all this so much in detail, because it
is to be believed and hoped that the severest part
of the crisis, so far as she is concerned, is over now.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>Since that evening, when she felt that she had
forgotten herself, she has at least not talked about
him, nor, as I know certainly, addressed a word to
J&#246;rgen. She has evidently esteemed his character
very highly, and has now suffered a disappointment.</p>

<p>It is not well to be young and have a great deal
of life that can suffer. I tell you, it is as with your
teeth; there is no peace until you have them all in
your table drawer.</p>

<p class="p3t">No, all this was not anything for father, Ma
thought.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Great-Ola was standing with a crowbar. There was
a stone which was to be placed in the wall. But the
frozen crust of earth was hard, up there on the
meadow, although the sun was so roasting hot that
he was obliged to wipe his forehead with his pointed
cap every time he rested.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officers had returned to
the office during the forenoon with their pay in
their pockets, one after the other; and that it was
pretty bad going with holes in the highway was evident
from their splashed carts, which were as if
they had been dipped in the mud.</p>

<p>He had just got ready to put the crowbar under
again, when he suddenly stopped. There was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
which attracted his attention&mdash;a cariole with
a post-boy walking by the side and a little yellow
horse covered with mud up to its belly.</p>

<p>With pieces of rope for reins and wound around
the cariole thills, the horse toiled up along the Gilje
hills in zigzag, incessantly stopping to get breath.
The sun was burning hot down there on the frozen
earth.</p>

<p>The post down from Drevstad&mdash;he knew both
the horse and the lumbering vehicle.</p>

<p>It was not that which would have taken his attention
so seriously; but some one was sitting in it&mdash;a
lady with hat and veil. He did not understand&mdash;that
way of carrying the head&mdash;wasn't it&mdash;</p>

<p>He took two or three slow, thoughtful steps,
then started on the jump, and over the wall with
a leap which would have touched the roof-beam
in a high room.</p>

<p>"Why, in the Lord's name, if it isn't Inger-Johanna
herself!" he ejaculated, as he suddenly
stood by the side of the horse. "What will the
capt&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the sight of her he suddenly had a misgiving
that perhaps everything might not be so well.</p>

<p>"And such a rattle-trap!" he said, recovering
himself, "is that fit for Inger-Johanna?"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Great-Ola, is father at home,
and mother? No, I am not so very well, but shall
be better now."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>She became silent again.</p>

<p>Great-Ola walked on, leading the horse by the
reins, when Inger-Johanna drove into the yard.</p>

<p>There stood her father under the painting-ladder,
looking up. He suddenly shaded his eyes, and
was at once with her by the cariole.</p>

<p>"Inger-Johanna!"</p>

<p>She hugged him tightly out there, and the captain,
dreadfully perplexed, drew her into the hall
to Ma, who was standing there dumb.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, what is the matter, Inger-Johanna?"
he burst out.</p>

<p>"Go in&mdash;go into the room a little, J&#228;ger." She
knew how little he could bear. "Let her talk with
me first, and then we will come in to you&mdash;it is
surely not anything irreparable."</p>

<p>"Father, Ma? Why should not father understand
me?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, child," the captain made haste to
say; he had hardly any voice left.</p>

<p>And she sat down there in the sitting-room with
her father by her side on the sofa and her mother
on a chair, and told them how she had fought and
striven to make herself fancy that her life's task lay
with R&#246;nnow.</p>

<p>She had created for herself a whole pile of illusions.</p>

<p>But then, on one day&mdash;and she also knew which
one&mdash;they became like extinguished lights for her&mdash;black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
as coal and empty, wherever she looked&mdash;not
what she had thought, not what she meant&mdash;like
throwing herself into a desert.</p>

<p>"And aunt insisted that I should choose the
pattern of my wedding dress. I think I should have
gone into it blindly, with my eyes shut, nevertheless;
for I thought of you, father, what you would
say, and of you, mother,&mdash;and of the whole world
outside, what it would say, if I thus, without any
trace of reason, broke my engagement. And then
I considered that everything was settled. I had
thrown myself into the water and was only sinking,
sinking&mdash;I had no right now to do anything
else than drown. But then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," a short ominous cough; the captain sat
looking on the floor with his hands on his knees.</p>

<p>"Then," resumed Inger-Johanna with a low
voice, still paler, and violently impressed with her
subject&mdash;"Nay, there need not be any secret from
you, father, and you, mother, since you otherwise
would not understand me;&mdash;it came almost like
a flash of lightning upon me, that for wholly one
year, and perhaps for two, I had had my whole
soul bound up with another."</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Grip," she whispered.</p>

<p>The captain had sat patiently and listened&mdash;entirely
patiently&mdash;till the last word. But now he
flew up and placed himself before her; he struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
his hands together on the backs, and stretched
them out, utterly without self-control.</p>

<p>"But, kingdom of heaven!" he broke out at last.
"Where are you!&mdash;What are you thinking of?
You can't for a single moment ever think of comparing
such a&mdash;Grip with a man like R&#246;nnow?&mdash;I
tell you, Inger-Johanna, your father is absolutely,
totally&mdash;you&mdash;you might just as well rise
up and strike me dead at once."</p>

<p>"Listen, father!" came from Inger-Johanna; at
the same moment she sprang up and stood before
him. "If Thinka and the others have not saved
themselves, no one shall trample on me."</p>

<p>Ma continued sitting with sharp, compressed
face.</p>

<p>"Such pure insanity!" The captain struck his
fist against his forehead and walked up and down
the floor disconsolately. "But now I see it;" he
stopped again, nodding to himself. "You have been
spoiled, dreadfully spoiled&mdash;spoiled, since you
were little&mdash;And then we get it again, only because
I think so much of you."</p>

<p>"The whole world could contradict me, father.
I have only my right way to go&mdash;to do as I have
done&mdash;write to R&#246;nnow, give full explanation, and
tell it to aunt. And," she leaned against the sofa and
looked down bitterly, as the remembrance came
over her, "aunt has done what she could, I can assure
you&mdash;thought, as you do, father, that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
pure insanity. She was so fond of me that she did
not care how much wretchedness it was for me if the
match only came off. So vain and young as I was,
she thought, all she had to do was to get Grip cried
down and pursued, so that he should stand without
means, hemmed in on all sides without any way
out, a man made an object of ridicule, who was
obliged to give up his purpose&mdash;only his father
over again. It was so easily done, as he fought for
his opinions unsupported, and it would be taken up
so readily, as she knew." She stood there so self-assured,
tremblingly lost in her own thoughts, with
downcast eyes and dark brows. She had become
thin and slim. "And now I have come home here
with more sorrow than I can tell you or explain&mdash;so
full of fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a silence during which strange emotions
were working in the captain. "Do you say
that we are not fond of you&mdash;will do you harm?
Well, then, perhaps, I might not consider it so
right hereafter, what you have done. I say perhaps;
but now I tell you that, if you must do it, then we
shall stand by it, just as you yourself wish in
the affair. You understand it, at all events. Why,
you have not even sat down, child. Let her have
something to eat, Ma, at once."</p>

<p>He started up. There was a good deal to be got
out of the way in her room, so she should not see
that repairs were going on.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter XIII</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> captain's house, freshly painted red, stood
there on the hillside through the summer, and
looked out over the country; it had become an
ornament to the district.</p>

<p>But Great-Ola did not see how it was. Since the
painting the captain was not like himself, some way
or other. It did not have the right good luck with it.
He came out there one time after another, and forgot
what he came after, so that he must turn back
again. Not a bad word to be heard from his mouth any
longer, far from that, and he did not box one's ears.</p>

<p>The captain did not feel safe from dizziness this
year. He went about continually making stops, and
the one who must always go with him on his different
trips over the grounds, stop when he stopped
and go when he went, was Inger-Johanna. It was as
if he seemed to find strength for himself in her erect
carriage, and besides wanted to make sure that she
was not going about grieving.</p>

<p>"Do you believe that she will ride or drive?"
he asked Ma out in the pantry. "She stands there
planting here and there and taking up and putting
down in the garden; she is not accustomed to that
now, Ma, you see. It seems to me, she is so serious.
But can you imagine what will become of her?
Huh," he sighed. "Nay, can you imagine it?" He
took a ladle of whey out of the tub&mdash;"Drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
plenty of whey, that thins the blood and prolongs
life, Rist says&mdash;so that she can be the captain's
daughter the longer here at Gilje&mdash;I have been
thinking, Ma, that I am not going down to the
sheriff's birthday on Thursday. Thinka is soon
coming up, and&mdash;Oh, it is good to drink when
one is thirsty."</p>

<p>On that same above named Thursday, the captain
went about more than commonly silent and
taciturn. Not a syllable at the dinner table, from the
time he sat down till he rose again and peevishly,
heavily, trudged up the stairs in order to take his
after-dinner nap as it now should be, sitting and only
for a moment.</p>

<p>He did not know whether he had closed his eyes
or not; it didn't matter, either.</p>

<p>He rushed out of the office door&mdash;"Suppose
they are now talking among themselves, Scharfenberg
and the others. Just as amusing as to run the
gauntlet through the whole country to travel down
there." He stood absorbed before the great clothes-press
out in the hall, when Inger-Johanna came up.
"Will you see something?" said he&mdash;"your long
boots when you were small."</p>

<p>She did not like to go into the housekeeping,
but developed a great activity in outside affairs. For
the present, the garden must be enlarged, the beds
must be measured and spaded, and the hedge planted
for Thinka's coming visit.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>With a straw hat on, she was in the garden from
early morning. There was such peace in being able
to work in the fresh air and escaping from sitting
over the sewing and thinking.</p>

<p class="p3t">The captain went about shrinking from the drill.</p>

<p>Ma had several times proposed to send for Rist;
but now she and Inger-Johanna in consultation determined
really to do so.</p>

<p>Such a calming down always followed the doctor's
visits.</p>

<p>Of course he should go to the drill-ground. A
little lively marching in rank and file took off the
fat so effectually and made the blood circulate as it
should. "You have never yet talked about your
head swimming when you were in camp, J&#228;ger. It
is just the right treatment, if you want to be allowed
a glass of punch again on this side of Christmas."</p>

<p>While G&#252;lcke was on the circuits, Thinka came
up on a visit.</p>

<p>The sisters were at home again together, talking
as in the old time; but neither of them wondered
any longer what there might be in the outside
world.</p>

<p>They knew that so well, both of them.</p>

<p>He felt so comfortable, the captain said, when
he saw Thinka sitting there with her knitting-work
and a novel, either out on the stairs or in the sitting-room.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p>"She is satisfied with her lot now, isn't she?" he
said to Ma.</p>

<p>He came back to it so often; it was as if he had
a secret disquietude on that point. By getting an
insight into the matter through Inger-Johanna, he
had to a degree got his eyes opened, at least to the
extent of a suspicion, as to the possibility that a
woman could be unhappy in a good match.</p>

<p>Then, on the other hand, his constant consolation
was that such as Inger-Johanna must be exceptional
examples of humanity&mdash;with her commanding
nature and intolerance of living under any one's
thumb.</p>

<p>But ordinary girls were not endowed with such
lofty feelings and thoughts&mdash;and Thinka was, as it
were, made for giving way and submitting to some
one.</p>

<p>All the same, the question still lay and writhed
like a worm in his stomach.</p>

<p class="p3t">"Inger-Johanna!" said Thinka out on the stairs,
"notice father, how unnerved he looks now, he is
walking down there by the garden fence&mdash;and he is
all the time forgetting his pipe; it is not halfsmoked
up before it goes out."</p>

<p>"So you think he is changed," said Inger-Johanna,
musing and resuming the conversation, up
in their room in the evening. "Poor father; it is so
absolutely impossible for him to get over it; I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
destined to be a parade horse. But do you believe he
would now demand it again of any of us?"</p>

<p>"You are strong, Inger-Johanna, and I suppose
you are right. But he has become so good," Thinka
said, sighing; "and it is that which makes me uneasy."</p>

<p>As the time drew nearer, he went about, dreading
more and more to go to the camp, so that Ma finally
began to believe that perhaps it was not advisable
for him to go, since he had himself so little courage
or desire for it. During the day, he would walk about
quite alone, so that he might come to shun people
altogether.</p>

<p>And the first real gleam of light she had seen for
a long time on his countenance was when she, notwithstanding,
proposed that he write to the army
surgeon for a certificate of sickness.</p>

<p>It went on smoothly enough after it was first set
in motion. And yet he seemed to repent it, so to
speak, when his leave of absence actually lay upon
his desk.</p>

<p>He went about annoyed and thought about them
all down there. Now Captain Vonderthan would
naturally spoil the men on the drill-ground; and
this one and that one was speculating, he supposed,
even now, on whether he would not possibly go
upon half pay. But he would disappoint them by
lasting as long as possible, if he should drink whey
the year round.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>The time, which was so absorbing and disturbing
to his mind, when the drill was taking place, was
over at last, and he had already, through Ma's persuasion,
by degrees reconciled himself to a possible
trip to the principal parish, when a scrap of a letter
from J&#246;rgen was brought in the mail, which put
them all in great distress.</p>

<p>He could not endure any longer to sit there as
the poorest in his class, and had shipped on board
a vessel which was going to sail that evening for
England. From there he hoped to find some means
of getting over to America, where he would try to
become a blacksmith or a wheelwright or something
else. He would not fail to write home to his dear
parents what his fate was.</p>

<p>"There, Ma," said the captain with a deep, trembling
voice, when at last he had got over his stupefaction
a little, "that Grip has been expensive for
us. It is nothing but his teaching."</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The autumn was already far advanced. The snow
had come and gone twice, and had now been swept
off by the wind from the slippery, hard frozen road.
The slopes and mountains were white, with red
and yellow tones of the frost-touched leaves of the
leafy forest still showing in many places, and the
lake down below was shining coldly blue, ready to
freeze over.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>There was a thundering over the country road
hard with frost, so it waked the echoes in the quiet
October day; one crow was standing, and another
started up from the hedge-post at the sound.</p>

<p>It was the wheels of a cariole, and in it was sitting,
with a long whip hanging down behind his
back, in cloak and large overshoes, the Captain of
Gilje.</p>

<p>He had been ten miles down and had his yearly
settlement with Bardon Kleven.</p>

<p>It is true, the bailiff had not been willing to let
him go out of the house without compelling him to
taste a little brandy in a small tumbler, with a little
ale in addition, and a little something to eat. But he
had been prudent. It was almost the only trip he
had made away from home for a long time, except
his visit to the sheriff.</p>

<p>Old Svarten ran over the long, flat stretches in
the heavy, strong trot to which he was accustomed;
the road showed that he was sharp shod with full
caulks. He knew that he was not to stop till he had
done the three miles to the foot of the steep ascent
up the Gilje hills.</p>

<p>It was probably because he was newly shod, and
the lumps of mud were so large and were frozen
hard; but now he stumbled.</p>

<p>It was the first time it had happened. Perhaps he
felt it himself, for he kept on at a brisker trot&mdash;but
then slackened up by degrees. He felt that the reins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
were loose and slack; their folds fell longer and
longer down over his shoulders.</p>

<p>The whip-lash hung down as before over the
captain's back, only still more slantingly.</p>

<p>He had begun to feel such cold shivers, just as if
he had suddenly got cold all over&mdash;and now he had
become so sleepy&mdash;had such a longing for a nap.</p>

<p>He saw the reins, the ears, and the hanging mane
over the neck of Svarten nodding up and down
before him, and the ground beneath him flying
away&mdash;</p>

<p>It was just as if a crow flew up and made it dark
right over his face; but he could not get his arm up
to catch it&mdash;so let it be.</p>

<p>And there stood the grain-poles, like crooked old
witches, crouched down&mdash;they wanted to avenge
themselves&mdash;with straw forelocks they resisted him
more and more like goblins and would forbid him
to get his arms up to take the reins and drive to
Gilje. They were swarming between heaven and
earth, as it were, swimming, dancing&mdash;were bright
and dark. Then there was something like a shout or
a crash from somewhere. There was Inger-Johanna
coming&mdash;</p>

<p>Svarten had got the reins quite down over his
forelegs; a little more and he would be stepping on
them.</p>

<p>From the gentle trot, into which he had at last
fallen, he began to walk.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>Then he turned his head round&mdash;and remained
standing in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>The whip-lash hung down as before. The captain
sat there immovable with his head a little tipped
back&mdash;</p>

<p>They were still on the level, and Svarten stood
patiently looking toward the Gilje hill, which lay
a bit farther on, until he turned his head round
again two or three times and looked into the cariole.</p>

<p>Now he began to paw on the ground with one
forefoot, harder and harder&mdash;so that the lumps flew
about.</p>

<p>Then he neighed.</p>

<p>A good hour later, in the twilight, there was a
conversation in an undertone out in the yard, and
the sound of cariole wheels which moved slowly.</p>

<p>Great-Ola was called down to the gate by the
man down yonder at the S&#246;rgaard; he had met the
cariole with the captain down in the road.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Ma's voice was heard to say through
the darkness from the porch.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At the entrance of the churchyard, a week later, old
Svarten and young Svarten stood before an empty
sleigh.</p>

<p>A salute before and after the lowering into the
ground informed the parish that here lay Captain
Peter Wennechen J&#228;ger.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter XIV</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">About</span> twenty years had passed, and the traffic
down in the country store and inn showed an
entirely different style both in building and goods.
There had also begun to be a route for travellers
and tourists in the summer up through the valley.</p>

<p>The snow drifted, so that it lay high up on the
steps this Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>But in the little warm room behind the shop
there was jollity. He had come up again, he, the delightful
Grip; and now he was sitting there with the
shopkeeper, the bailiff's man, and the execution-server.</p>

<p>Only let him get a little something to drink.</p>

<p>"Your health, you old execution-horse!" came
in Grip's voice&mdash;"When I think of all those whom
you have taken the skin off without ever getting
any part in the roast, I can get up a kind of sympathy
for you; we are both of us cheated souls."</p>

<p>"Although I have not acquired the learning and
sciences"&mdash;began the gray-headed man who had
been spoken to, somewhat irritated&mdash;"I insist
on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything lawful, yes&mdash;oh&mdash;oh&mdash;never
mind that, Reierstad. Consider that science is the
sea of infinity, and a few drops more or less do not
count either for or against. Just peep out a little
into the starry night, and you will have a suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
that the whole of the planet, my friend, on which
you parade in such a very small crevice, is only one
pea in the soup&mdash;soup, I say&mdash;it is all the same.
Isn't that so, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Simensen?"</p>

<p>He always appealed to the shop boy, who, with
his small pig's eyes, smiled very superciliously and
was evidently flattered.</p>

<p>"And in regard to the last information, one ought
to have a little something to reinforce the oil in
the lamp with, Sir."</p>

<p>It was the execution-server who had stood treat
first&mdash;a pint and a half bottle of spirits.</p>

<p>The execution-server had a kind of ancient deferential
respect for Grip. He knew that he had belonged
to the higher sphere, and that he still, whenever
he liked, might show himself in the houses
both of the sheriff and of old Rist, places which he
never left without improvements in his outfit.</p>

<p>"I will confide a secret to you, Reierstad. If you
are a little of a genius, then you must drink&mdash;at
least it was true in my time. There was great havoc
on that kind, you see, on account of the vacuum.
Did you not notice something of that?"</p>

<p>"Hi, hi, hi," neighed Simensen.</p>

<p>"Yes, you understand what I mean, Simensen?&mdash;A
good glass of punch extract in this frost&mdash;of
yours in the shop&mdash;would taste so good now,
wouldn't it? I am not at present flush of money;
but if you will have the goodness to put it down."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>Simensen caught the idea, of course. "All right,
then."</p>

<p>"As you grease the wheels, the carriage goes,
you know very well, my dear Simensen&mdash;and,
well,&mdash;there comes the fluid.&mdash;Do you want to
know why we drink?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it can't be so very difficult to fathom that."</p>

<p>"No, no; but yet it may perhaps be placed in a
higher light, which a man like you will not fail to
appreciate&mdash;you know there is a great objection to
new illumination fluids, besides&mdash;you see, hm!"
He seated himself comfortably&mdash;"You live in a
thin coat and cold, poor conditions&mdash;are ashamed
of yourself at heart&mdash;feel that you are sinking as a
man, day by day. If there is a discussion, you don't
dare to assert yourself; if you are placed at a table,
you don't dare to speak. And then&mdash;only two
drams&mdash;two glasses of poor brandy for spectacles
to see through&mdash;and <i>ein</i>, <i>zwei</i>, <i>drei</i>, <i>marsch</i>! The
whole world is another!&mdash;You become yourself,
feel that you are in that health and vigor which you
were once intended for; your person becomes independent,
proud, and bold; the words fall from your
lips; your ideas are bright; people admire. The two
glasses&mdash;only two glasses&mdash;I do not refuse, however,
the three, four, five, and six, your health!&mdash;make
the difference&mdash;you know what the difference
is, Simensen!&mdash;between his healthy and his
sick man, while the man whom the world struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
down&mdash;well, yes&mdash;But the two glasses carry him
always farther&mdash;farther&mdash;inexorably farther, you
see&mdash;until he ends in the workhouse. That was a
big syllogism."</p>

<p>"Yes, it certainly was," said Simensen, nodding
to the execution-server; "it took half a bottle with
it."</p>

<p>Grip sat there mumbling.</p>

<p>The strong drink had plainly got more and more
hold on him; he had been out in the cold the whole
day. His boots were wet and in bad condition. But
he continued to drink; almost alone he had disposed
of the punch extract.</p>

<p>"Come, come, don't sit there so melancholy&mdash;or
there won't be any more to get," Simensen prodded
him.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;no, no&mdash;more syllogisms, you mean&mdash;something
Reierstad also can understand." He
nodded his head in quiet, dull self-communion.
"Came across an emaciated, pale child, who was crying
so utterly helplessly down here. There is much
that screams helplessly&mdash;you know, Reierstad!&mdash;if
one has once got an ear for the music, and has
not a river of tears&mdash;there, you drink, drink. Give
me the bottle."</p>

<p>"It were best to get him to bed over in the servants'
room, now," suggested Simensen.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the pig is drunk," muttered Grip.</p>

<p>Monday morning he was off again, before daylight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
without having tasted anything; he was shy
so early, before he had got his first dram to stiffen
him up.</p>

<p>Grip had his own tactics. He was known over
very nearly the whole of the country south of the
Dovrefjeld.</p>

<p>As he had had fits of drinking and going on a
spree, so he had had corresponding periods when
he had lived soberly in the capital, studying and
giving instruction. Again and again he awoke the
most well-grounded hopes in his few old comrades
and friends who remained there. A man with such a
talent for teaching and such a remarkable gift for
grasping the roots of words and the laws of language,
not only in Greek and Latin, but right up
into the Sanscrit, might possibly even yet attain to
something. Based on his total abstinence for three
and four months and his own strong self-control,
they would already begin to speak of bringing about
his installation at some school of a higher grade,
when all at once, unexpectedly, it was again reported
that he had disappeared from the city.</p>

<p>Then he would pop up again after the lapse of
some weeks&mdash;entirely destitute, in one of the
country districts, shaking and thin and worn from
drink, from exposure, from lying in outhouses and
in haylofts, seldom undressed and in a proper bed.</p>

<p>Along in the afternoon he appeared at the sheriff's
house.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>G&#252;lcke was the only one of the functionaries of
his time who still kept his office, after Rist had left.
He was still there, nursed by a careful wife, who
had ever surrounded him with a padding of pillows,
visible and invisible.</p>

<p>Grip knew what he was doing; he wanted to find
the mistress, while the sheriff was in his office.</p>

<p>She was sitting in an easy chair snugly behind
the double windows in the sitting-room with her
knitting-work and <i>The Wandering Jew</i> before her,
while her clever sister Thea, an unmarried woman
now in the thirties, was looking after the dinner out
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Thinka took the care of the house upon herself
after Miss G&#252;lcke's death, and was her old husband's
support and crutch unweariedly the whole
twenty-four hours together.</p>

<p>And these greasy, worn books of fiction from
the city, with numbers on their backs, were the
little green spot left for her to pass her own life on.</p>

<p>Like so many other women of those times, to
whom reality had not left any other escape than
to take any man who could support her, she lived
in these novels&mdash;in the midst of the most harshly
creaking commonplaces&mdash;a highly strained life of
fancy. There she imagined the passions she herself
might have had. There were loves and hates, there
were two noble hearts&mdash;in spite of everything&mdash;happily
united; or she consoled picturesque heroes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
who in despair were gazing into the billows.</p>

<p>There&mdash;in the clouds&mdash;was continued the life
with its unquenchable thirst of the heart and of
the spirit for which reality had not given any firm
foothold&mdash;and there the matronly figure which had
become somewhat large, cozily round and plump,
and which was once the small, slender Thinka,
transferred her still unforgotten Aas from one
heroic form to another&mdash;from Emilie Carl&#233;n to
James, from Walter Scott to Bulwer, from Alexander
Dumas to Eug&#232;ne Sue.</p>

<p>There in her domestic, bustling sister's place lay
the sewing, with a ray of sunshine on the chair.</p>

<p>The dark inlaid sewing-table was Thea's inheritance
from Ma. And the silver thimble, with the
shell old and worn thin inside and out, broken and
cracked at the top and on the edges, she used and
saved, because her mother had used it all her time.
It stood, left behind like a monument to Ma&mdash;to
all the weary stitches&mdash;and pricks&mdash;of her honorably
toiling, self-sacrificing&mdash;shall we call it life?</p>

<p>It was more at a pressure than by regularly
knocking that the door to the sitting-room was
opened, and Grip cautiously entered.</p>

<p>"You, Grip? No, no, not by the door, sit down
up there by the window. Then my sister will get
you a little something to eat,&mdash;oh, you can manage
to eat a little bread and butter and salt meat,
can't you? Well, so you are up this way, Grip?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>"Seeking a chance to teach, I may say, Mrs.
G&#252;lcke," was the evasive reply. "I am told you have
heard from J&#246;rgen over in America," he hastily
added, to get away from the delicate subject.</p>

<p>"Yes, just think: J&#246;rgen is a well-to-do, rich
manager of a machine-shop over in Savannah. He
has now written two letters and wants to have his
eldest sister come over; but Inger-Johanna is not
seeking for happiness any more&mdash;" she added with
a peculiar emphasis.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>Grip, with a very trembling hand, placed the plate
of bread and butter, which the maid had brought,
on the sewing-table. He had drunk the dram on the
side of the plate. There was a twitching about his lips.</p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure, exceeding great pleasure,"
he uttered in a voice which he controlled with
difficulty. "You see, Mrs. G&#252;lcke, that J&#246;rgen has
amounted to something I count as one of the few
rare blades of grass that have grown up out of my
poor life."</p>

<p>Sleigh-bells sounded out in the road; a sleigh
glided into the yard.</p>

<p>"The judge's," Thinka said.</p>

<p>Grip comprehended that he would not be wanted
just now, and rose.</p>

<p>Thinka hastened out into a side room and came
in again with a dollar bill&mdash;"Take it, Grip&mdash;a little
assistance till you get some pupils."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>His hand hesitated a little before he took it.
"One&mdash;must&mdash;must&mdash;" He seized his cap and
went out.</p>

<p>Down by the gate he stopped a little, and looked
back. The window had been thrown open there.</p>

<p>"Airing out after Grip," he muttered bitterly,
while he took the direction of the valley, with his
comforter high up around his neck and his cap,
which down in the main parish had replaced his
old, curled up felt hat, down over his ears; in the
cold east wind he protected his hands in the pockets
of his old thin coat, which was flapping about his
emaciated form.</p>

<p>It was not an uncommon route, whither he went
over the mountains in his widely extended rambles
in the summer, or, as now, in the short, dark midwinter,
when he was obliged to confine himself to
the highway.</p>

<p>This country district had an attraction for him,
as it were; he listened and watched everywhere he
came for even the least bit of what he could catch up
about Inger-Johanna, while he carefully avoided
her vicinity.</p>

<p>"The young lady of Gilje," as she was called,
lived in a little house up there, which she had
bought with one of the four thousand dollars that
old Aunt Alette had given to her by will.</p>

<p>She kept a school for the children of the region,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
and read with those of the captain, the newly settled
doctor, and the bailiff.</p>

<p>And now she had many boys to care for, whom
she had got places in the country round about,
while in the course of years she had striven to put
several young geniuses from the neighborhood in
the way of getting on down in the cities.</p>

<p>She was imperious, and gave occasion for
people's talk by her unusually independent conduct;
but to her face she met pure respect. She was
still, at her fortieth year, delicate and slender, with
undiminished, even if more quiet, fire in her eyes,
and hair black as a raven.</p>

<p>She sought for talents in the children like four-leaved
clover on the hills, as she was said to have
expressed it; and when Grip, down at Thinka's,
talked of J&#246;rgen's happy escape from his surroundings
as one of the few green leaves in his life,
he then suppressed the most secret thought he
cherished, that her little school was an offshoot
propagated by his ideas.</p>

<p class="p3t">In the twilight the next afternoon a form stole up
to the fence around her schoolroom&mdash;the longing
to catch, if possible, a glimpse of her drove him
nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Now he was standing close to the window.</p>

<p>An obscure form now and then moved before it.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>An uncertain gleam was playing about in there
from the mouth of the stove. The lamp was not
yet lighted, and he heard the voice of a boy reciting
something which he had learned by heart, but
did not know well; it sounded like verse&mdash;it must
be the children from the captain's house.</p>

<p>The entry door was open, and a little later he
was standing in it, listening breathlessly.</p>

<p>He heard her voice&mdash;her voice.</p>

<p>"Recite it, Ingeborg&mdash;boys are so stupid in
such things."</p>

<p>It was a poem from the Norwegian history.
Ingeborg's voice came clearly:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>And that was young Queen Gyda,</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>The flower in King Harald's spring&mdash;</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Walks yet so proud a maiden</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Over the mountain ling?</i></div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Highborn was she and haughty,</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Her seat she would not share;</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>The Hordaland damsels away she sent,</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>And the Rogaland girls must fare.</i></div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>She willed a kingdom united</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>To the outermost skerrie bare,</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>A king for a queen, the whole of a man</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>For a maid&mdash;and none to share.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He stood as if rooted to the floor, until he heard
Inger-Johanna say, "I will now light the lamp, and
give you your lessons for to-morrow."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately he was away before the window.</p>

<p>He saw her head in the glow of the lamp just
lighted&mdash;that purity in the shape of her eyebrows
and in the lines of her face&mdash;that unspeakably
beautiful, serious countenance, only even more
characteristically stamped&mdash;that old erect bearing
with the tall, firm neck.</p>

<p>It was a picture which had stood within him all
these years&mdash;of her who should have been his if he
had attained to what he ought to have attained in
life&mdash;if it had offered him what it should have&mdash;and
if he himself had been what he ought to have
been.</p>

<p>He stood there stupefied as if in a dizzy intoxication&mdash;and
then went away with long strides,
when he heard the children coming out into the
entry.</p>

<p>His feet bore him without his knowing it.</p>

<p>Now he was far down the Gilje hills, and the
moonlight began to shine over the ridges. He still
hurried on; his blood was excited; he saw&mdash;almost
talked with her.</p>

<p>A sleigh came trotting slowly behind him with
the bells muffled by the frost.</p>

<p>It was old Rist, who was sitting nodding in his fur
coat, exhausted by what he had enjoyed at Gilje.</p>

<p>"If you are going over the lake, Grip, jump on
behind," he said by way of salutation, after looking
at him a little.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, if you could only leave off drinking,"
he began to admonish&mdash;</p>

<p>Before the lamp thus&mdash;it ran in Grip's thoughts&mdash;she
set the milky shade slowly down over the
chimney, and a gleam passed over her delicate
mouth and chin&mdash;the dark, closely fitting dress&mdash;and
the forehead, while she bowed her magnificent
head&mdash;she looked up&mdash;straight towards the window&mdash;</p>

<p>"And if you will only try to resist it&mdash;at the time
the fit comes on&mdash;which is the same as the very
Satan himself."</p>

<p>Grip was not inclined to hear any more, and it
was cold to hang on over the lake.</p>

<p>He jumped off and let old Rist continue his talk
in the idea that he was standing behind him.</p>

<p>It was a cold, biting wind out on the ice.</p>

<p>For a while he saw his own shadow, with his
hands in his coat pockets, moving away, while the
moon sailed through the clouds&mdash;the lamp shone
so warmly on her face&mdash;</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Three days afterwards, towards evening, Inger-Johanna
stood at the window looking out. Her
breast heaved with strong emotion.</p>

<p>Grip had died of pneumonia down at the L&#246;vviggaard.</p>

<p>She had been down and taken care of him till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
now she had come home&mdash;talked with him, heard
herself live in his wild raving, and had received his
last intelligent look before it was quenched....</p>

<p>The moon was so cold and clear in the heavens.
The whole landscape with the mountains and all
the great pure forms shone magically white in the
frost&mdash;white as in the snow-fields of the lofty
mountains....</p>

<p>"The power of the spirit is great," she said, sighing
in sorrowful, yet trembling meditation&mdash;"he
gave me something to live on."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
